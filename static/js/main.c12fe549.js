Did deficiencies in government performance further erode trust in public institutions? Did citizens\u2019 ideology interfere with the way they processed information on government performance? To investigate these two questions, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment in Spain in November 2020. Respondents in the treatment group were provided information on the number of contact tracers in their region, a key policy variable under the control of regional governments. We find that individuals greatly over-estimate the number of contact tracers in their region. When we provide the actual number of contact tracers, we find a decline in trust in governments, a reduction in willingness to fund public institutions and a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We also find that individuals endogenously change their attribution of responsibilities when receiving the treatment. In regions where the regional and central governments are controlled by different parties, sympathizers of the regional incumbent react to the negative news on performance by attributing greater responsibility for it to the central government. We call this the blame shifting effect. In those regions, the negative information does not translate into lower voting intentions for the regional incumbent government. These results suggest that the exercise of political accountability may be particularly difficult in settings with high political polarization and areas of responsibility that are not clearly delineated.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2306e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 January 2023"},{"id":1,"date":"23/01/2023","day":23,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"A house price-at-risk model to monitor the downside risk for the Spanish housing market","authors":"Gergely Ganics and Mar\xeda Rodr\xedguez-Moreno","abstract":"We present a house price-at-risk (HaR) model that fits the historical developments in the Spanish housing market.

In particular, the model features sector interactions along several dimensions in an open economy setting, either in the provision of intermediate inputs and capital goods or competing in the labour market. This framework is flexible enough to provide insights into the effect of several policy-relevant shocks, such as global value chain bottlenecks, increases in production costs in energy-intensive sectors or large public investment programmes. In order to illustrate the role of such sectoral interactions, we consider a sectorisation of Next Generation EU (NGEU) funds based on Spain\u2019s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP) which will mobilize \u20ac69.5 bn in grants. According to our findings, the average impact over a 5-year horizon is 1.15% of GDP if we consider only the direct effect of the investment programmes and expenditure plans, but it increases to 1.75% if we take into account the increase in the productive capacity of certain sectors and its propagation through the production network. Moreover, the resulting expansion is particularly strong in sectors highly dependent on high-skilled labour, such as IT and professional services, which might lead to shortages of high-skilled workers, reducing the aggregate impact on GDP by 25%.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2305e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 January 2023"},{"id":4,"date":"19 January 2023","day":19,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"The Bank of Amsterdam and the limits of fiat money","authors":"Wilko Bolt, Jon Frost, Hyun Song Shin, Peter Wierts","abstract":"Central banks can operate with negative equity, and many have done so in history without undermining trust in fiat money.

A range of DeFi protocols implements these services as a suite of smart contracts, ie software programs that encode the logic of conventional financial operations. Instead of transacting with a counterparty, DeFi users thus interact with software programs that pool the resources of other DeFi users to maintain control over their funds. This paper provides a deep dive into the overall architecture, the technical primitives, and the financial functionalities of DeFi protocols. We analyse and explain the individual components and how they interact through the lens of a DeFi stack reference (DSR) model featuring three layers: settlement, applications and interfaces. We discuss the technical aspects of each layer of the DSR model. Then, we describe the financial services for the most relevant DeFi categories, ie decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, derivatives protocols and aggregators. The latter exploit the property that smart contracts can be \\"composed\\", ie utilize the functionalities of other protocols to provide novel financial services. We discuss how composability allows complex financial products to be assembled, which could have applications in the traditional financial industry. We discuss potential sources of systemic risk and conclude by mapping out an agenda for research in this area.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1066.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 January 2023"},{"id":6,"date":"17/01/2023","day":17,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"New supply bottlenecks index based on newspaper data","authors":"Pablo Burriel, Iv\xe1n Kataryniuk, Carlos Moreno P\xe9rez and Francesca Viani","abstract":"We develop a new monthly indicator of supply bottlenecks using newspaper articles.

Using Spanish firm-level data covering the period 1999-2019, we show that an expansionary monetary policy shock leads to a decrease in capital misallocation, as measured by the within-industry dispersion of firms\u2019 marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK). To analyse the mechanism behind this finding, we first explore the intensive margin and show that high-MRPK firms increase their investment and their debt financing relatively more than low-MRPK firms after monetary policy easing. We also document that a firm\u2019s MRPK is a much stronger driver of its investment sensitivity to monetary policy than its age, leverage or cash. These findings suggest that MRPK is a good proxy for financial frictions. Second, we explore the extensive margin and show that monetary policy easing increases entry and decreases exit, although the effect is quantitatively small, and it does not lead to significant changes in the composition of high- and low-MRPK entrants or exiters. Overall, the evidence points to expansionary monetary policy decreasing capital misallocation mainly through the relaxation of financial frictions of incumbent, productive, constrained firms.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2302e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 January 2023"},{"id":9,"date":"13 January 2023","day":13,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Monetary policy and credit card spending","authors":"Francesco Grigoli, Damiano Sandri","abstract":"We analyze the impact of monetary policy on consumer spending using confidential credit card data.

While interest rate hikes strongly curb spending-especially if coupled with reductions in stock prices reflecting pure monetary policy shocks-interest rate cuts appear unable to lift spending.

An increase of steady state inflation curbs the markups, especially those of the more productive firms, hence attenuating the inefficient dispersion of markups. At low levels of inflation, the gains from the reduction in misallocation outweigh the cost of inflation. Heterogeneity in productivity and strategic complementarities in price setting, the key ingredients of our model, imply that also firms\' response to shocks is heterogenous: less productive firms transmit cost shocks to prices much more than more productive ones.

The second is a neglect of expectations data driven by a strong belief that inflation expectations were firmly anchored and so inflation increases would be temporary. The third is an over-reliance on the credibility earned in the past, creating an illusion of too much room to focus on the recovery of real activity and underpredicting the resulting inflation. The fourth is a revision of strategy that made central banks tolerant of higher inflation because of the trend fall in the return on government bonds, even though the return on private capital stayed high.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1060.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 December 2022"},{"id":37,"date":"16 December 2022","day":16,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Cryptocurrencies and Decentralised Finance (DeFi)","authors":"Igor Makarov, Antoinette Schoar","abstract":"The paper provides an overview of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.

The proposed algorithm, which is based on tempered importance sampling, adapts the model-based density forecasts to target distributions the researcher has access to. As an example, this paper shows how to implement the algorithm by conditioning the forecasting densities of a BVAR and a DSGE model on information about the marginal densities of future oil prices. The results show that increased asymmetric upside risks to oil prices result in upside risks to inflation as well as higher core-inflation over the considered forecasting horizon.

We observe a hump-shaped relationship between a country\'s investment rate and its level of development, both within countries over time and across countries. Advanced economies reach their investment peak at a higher level of income and at an earlier point in time relative to emerging markets. We also observe the familiar patterns of structural change (a decline in the agricultural share and an increase in the services share, both relative to manufacturing). The pace of change observed in the 1930 to 1980 period in advanced economies is remarkably similar to that in emerging markets since 1960. Motivated by these facts, we develop a two-region model of the world economy that captures the dynamics of investment and structural change. The regions are isolated from each other up to the point of capital market liberalization in the early 1990s. At that point, capital flows from advanced economies to emerging markets and accelerates the process of structural change in emerging markets. Both regions gain from the liberalization of financial markets, but the majority of the gains accrue to the emerging economies. The overall magnitude of gains depends on the date of liberalization, the relative sizes of the two regions and the degree of asymmetry between the two regions at the point of liberalization. Finally, we consider the impact of a \\"second wave\\" of liberalization when China fully opens its economy to capital inflows.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/a-north-south-model-of-structural-change-and-growth.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" December 2022"},{"id":48,"date":"December 2022","day":"  ","month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Understanding the Strength of the Dollar","authors":"Zhengyang Jiang, Robert Richmond, and Tony Zhang","abstract":"We link the sustained appreciation of the U.S. dollar from 2011 to 2019 to international capital flows driven by primitive economic factors.

Nevertheless, an increase in economic activity generates more information about productivity, regardless of which type of shock it arises from. Moreover, a decrease in economic uncertainty leads to a decline in term premia as longer-term bonds are risky on average.

We find that an increase of 8% in the number of pharmacies lowered medical hospitalizations by 1.1% and the related expenditure by 1.3%. The drop is concentrated on short hospitalizations of children and elderly patients. We do not find any impact on a control group of surgical hospitalizations. Pharmacies appear to reduce hospitalizations by giving information to people who would otherwise go to a hospital.","linkarticle":"https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/temi-discussione/2022/2022-1388/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1","centralbank":"Bank of Italy","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 November 2022"},{"id":63,"date":"23 November 2022","day":23,"month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Mediation Analysis Synthetic Control","authors":"Giovanni Mellace and Alessandra Pasquini","abstract":"This paper contributes to the literature on the methods investigating the causal channels determining the impact of a specific event (e.g. the introduction of a public policy, a firm bankruptcy or a natural disaster).\\nThis paper introduces a new method to investigate the causal mechanism determining the impact of a specific event.

We explore the implications of two design features: interest rate and convenience value. Increasing the CBDC interest rate past a point where it becomes a binding floor, increases deposit rates but leads to greater inequality of market shares in both deposit and lending markets and can reduce the responsiveness of deposit rates to changes in the IOR rate.

We show that: more than half of the increase in the retired share are \\"excess retirements\\" that would likely not have occurred in the absence of the pandemic; excess retirements have been concentrated among cohorts age 65 and older at the start of the pandemic; excess retirements have been largest among the college-educated and whites; and excess retirements reflect in part that worker transitions from the labor force to retirement remain elevated. We also show that failing to account for updated population controls to the Current Population Survey leads to an underestimate of the rise in the retired share over the last few years. We use a cohort-based framework to argue that looking forward, unless the pandemic has permanently affected retirement behavior, excess retirements should eventually fade as those who retired early during the pandemic reach ages when they would have normally retired. Even as excess retirements fade, the retired share will remain well above its pre-pandemic level, reflecting population aging.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-great-retirement-boom.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" November 2022"},{"id":92,"date":"November 2022","day":"  ","month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Demand Shocks, Hysteresis and Monetary Policy","authors":"Jae Sim","abstract":"This paper builds a micro-founded general equilibrium model of hysteresis in which changing composition of firms with heterogeneous qualities in response to demand shocks alter the total factor productivity of the economy through a process of \\"creative destruction\\".

This paper investigates their welfare effects and quantifies their welfare costs using sufficient statistics. The special role of banks as liquidity providers is embedded in an otherwise standard general equilibrium growth model. Capital and liquidity requirements mitigate moral hazard from deposit insurance, which, if unchecked, can lead to excessive credit and liquidity risk at banks. However, these regulations are also costly because they reduce the ability of banks to create net liquidity and can distort investment. Equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of demand for liquidity, yielding two simple sufficient statistics that express the welfare cost of each requirement as a function of observable variables only. Based on U.S. data, the welfare cost of a 10 percent liquidity requirement is equivalent to a permanent loss in consumption of about 0.02%, a modest impact. Even using a conservative estimate, the cost of a similarly-sized increase in the capital requirement is roughly ten times as large. Even so, optimal policy relies on both requirements, as the \x85financial stability benefi\x85ts of capital requirements are found to be broader.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-welfare-effects-of-bank-liquidity-and-capital-requirements.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" November 2022"},{"id":101,"date":"November 2022","day":"  ","month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Demand Segmentation in the Federal Funds Market","authors":"Manjola Tase","abstract":"This paper outlines a model of demand segmentation in the federal funds market with two types of borrowers - the \\"interest on reserves (IOR) arbitrage\\" type and the \\"regulatory\\" type - which have different reservation prices and cannot always be separated.

In particular, after an increase in the policy rate, the model predicts that loan rates and default probabilities increase in both sectors.

The split of topics suggests that the Q&A does not only provide clarification of what has been said in the introductory statement, but also allows journalists to enquire about the discussion within the Governing Council as well as the ECB\u2019s stance on broader economic issues.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2742~d05e72b213.en.pdf?2f8a544cb0938de61240aa799cdd37fe","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 October 2022"},{"id":111,"date":"17 October 2022","day":17,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"The role of central bank communication in inflation-targeting Eastern European emerging economies","authors":"Valerio Astuti, Alessio Ciarlone and Alberto Coco","abstract":"This paper examines whether central bank communication in the three main Central and Eastern European countries adopting an inflation-targeting regime is effective in providing guidance on monetary policy decisions and influencing private agents\' inflation expectations and financial market reactions.

Nevertheless, the real-time dimension of such relationships is less studied, and it remains unclear how to incorporate them in a forecasting framework. This can be partly explained by a certain divide between the economic and political science contributions in this area, as well as by the traditional lack of availability of high-frequency indicators measuring such phenomena. The latter constraint, though, is becoming less of a limiting factor through the production of text-based indicators. In this paper we assemble a dataset of such monthly measures of what we call \u201cinstitutional instability\u201d, for three representative emerging market economies: Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. We then forecast quarterly GDP by adding these new variables to a standard macro-forecasting model in a mixed-frequency MIDAS framework.

Second, we find that low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) funds, which invest in non-public debt assets while offering a stable NAV, face higher redemptions than other fund types. The risk of breaching the regulatory NAV limit may have incentivised outflows among some LVNAV investors in March 2020.

Existing empirical literature has only found that carbon pricing schemes are generally associated to a transitory effect on the level of inflation. This paper assesses empirically the effects of carbon pricing on inflation volatility for both carbon tax and cap-and-trade schemes (also known as emission trading systems). Our work finds strong evidence that cap-and-trade schemes are associated with larger volatility in CPI headline inflation, while no significant effect is found in the case of carbon taxes. This effect seems to feed only through the energy component, and does not seem to affect the volatility of core inflation. In addition, we find that under cap-and-trade schemes, both the increase in the underlying price of emissions and the expansion in the activities covered by these initiatives are associated with greater inflation volatility. These findings have important policy implications, given that inflation volatility could complicate the conduct of monetary policy. Since the ambition to mitigate climate change in the years to come is expected to be implemented through broader coverage of carbon pricing, central banks should monitor those developments closely.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2231e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 October 2022"},{"id":127,"date":"03 October 2022","day":3,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"The scarring effects of deep contractions","authors":"David Aikman, Mathias Drehmann, Mikael Juselius, Xiaochuan Xing","abstract":"We find that deep contractions have highly persistent scarring effects, depressing the level of GDP at least a decade hence.

Insurance premiums (rates) are subject to significant regulations at a state level in the United States. Using novel data on filings made by insurers to regulators, we propose a metric to quantify the extent of regulation in individual states. We provide evidence of decoupling of insurance rates from their underlying risks and identify regulation as a driving force behind this pattern. Rates are least reflective of risk in states we classify as \\"high friction\\", i.e. states where regulations appear most restrictive. We identify two sources behind the decoupling. First, in high friction states, rates have not adequately adjusted in response to the growth in losses. Second, insurers have cross-subsidized high friction states by raising rates in low friction states. Our results imply that households in low friction states are disproportionately bearing the risks of households in high friction states. More broadly, our findings question whether insurance rates can play a useful role in steering climate adaptation and whether households will have continued access to insurance.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/pricing-of-climate-risk-insurance-regulation-and-cross-subsidies.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" October 2022"},{"id":137,"date":"29/09/2022","day":29,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"The Curious Incidence of Monetary Policy Across the Income Distribution","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-416-the-curious-incidence-of-monetary-policy-across-the-income-distribution.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 September 2022"},{"id":138,"date":"28 September 2022","day":28,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Consumer savings behaviour at low and negative interest rates","authors":"Marco Felici, Geoff Kenny, Roberta Friz","abstract":"We study interest rates transmission to savings at low and negative rates.

By leveraging confidential supervisory and credit register data, we uncover two main findings. First, capital relief measures support banks\' capacity to supply credit to firms. Second, not all measures are equally successful. Banks adjust their credit supply only if the capital relief is permanent or implemented through established processes that foresee long release periods. By contrast, discretionary relief measures are met with limited success, possibly owing to the uncertainty surrounding their capital replenishment path. Moreover, requirement releases are more effective for banks with a low capital headroom over requirements and do not trigger additional risk-taking. These findings provide key insights on how to design effective bank capital requirement releases in crisis time.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2720~e6f3686548.en.pdf?2982e984581f593be8f316d8ee31474e","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 September 2022"},{"id":159,"date":"14 September 2022","day":14,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Immigrants and the distribution of income and wealth in the euro area: first facts and implications for monetary policy","authors":"Maarten Dossche, Aleksandra Kolndrekaj, Maximilian Propst, Javier Ramos Perez, Jiri Slacalek","abstract":"We use household surveys to describe differences in wages, income, wealth and liquid assets of households born in their country of residence (\u201cnatives\u201d) vs. those born in other EU and non-EU countries (\u201cimmigrants\u201d).

The survey reveals that central banks have notably increased their cyber security-related investments since 2020, giving technical security control and resiliency priority. Central banks see phishing and social engineering as the most common methods of attack, and the potential losses from a systemically relevant cyber attack are deemed to be large, especially if the target is a big tech providing critical cloud infrastructures. Generally, respondents judge the preparedness of the financial sector for cyber attacks to be inadequate. While central banks in most emerging market economies provide a framework for the collection of information on cyber attacks on financial institutions, less than half of those in advanced economies do.

My main finding is that expected, rather than current, GDP growth shapes the dynamics of firm entry. Specifically, I find that entry increases with past exits at the sector-level, but only when aggregate GDP growth is forecasted to be strong. Also, with strong growth forecasts, past entry developments weight less on the subsequent sectoral entry dynamics. Periods of low entry and high exit, can therefore be followed by strong entry subsequently, when the economy is expected to grow strongly.

Make-up strategies not only foster the alignment of inflation with target but also support productivity-improving investment in R&D and technology adoption and hence the long-run trend path, provided that the inherent make-up element is sufficiently pronounced. Inflation is less responsive to monetary policy due to the interaction with productivity dynamics.

The financial markets are highly integrated, and valuations of financial assets follow international patterns, which has contributed to large increases in financial wealth over the past 25 years. Nonetheless, this has not led to an equally large increase in property income because the rates of return have decreased during the same era. Moreover, changes in functional income distribution (capital/labour shares) have not been fully transmitted to the distribution of primary income between households because other institutional sectors \u2013 particularly the government sector \u2013 hold considerable amounts of financial assets. At least in the short term, the decrease in rates of return seems to contradict claims that, due to an increase in both financial and inherited wealth, we are entering an era of increasing income inequality. In this article, the link between financial wealth and pre-tax household income distribution is scrutinised for three European countries using a conceptually fully consistent macro framework. First, national balance sheets are combined with the related income flows.

The source of preferred habitat demand is an insurance fund that issues annuities and adopts a liability-driven strategy to minimise the duration risk on its balance sheet. The optimising behaviour of the insurance fund implies a preferred-habitat demand function that is upward-sloping in bond prices and downward-sloping in bond yields, especially when interest rates are low. This supports the operation of a recruitment channel at low interest rates, whereby long-term interest rates react strongly to short-term policy rates because of complementary changes in term premia induced by preferred-habitat demand.

Agents exchange short-term debt contracts to invest in a long-term risky asset, and receive shocks to the opportunity cost of funds (cost shocks) and news about the fundamental of the asset, both of which are private information. Asset prices play a dual role of clearing markets and conveying agents\' private information, but markets are informationally inefficient: Agents can partially, but never fully, infer their counterparties\' private information from asset prices. The informational inefficiency of markets is more acute when liquidity conditions are especially tight or loose, as this impairs ability of prices to reveal private information about fundamentals. As a result, beliefs about fundamentals are shaped endogenously by cost shocks which are orthogonal to fundamentals, leading to socially costly booms and busts in asset prices. The equilibrium is constrained inefficient due to an information externality in which agents do not internalize how their choices affect the information set of other agents.

We explain this finding with the endogenous policy reaction of monetary authorities in emerging markets that stabilizes the exchange rate against the dollar and weakens the invoicing channel of dollar shocks.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2684~e73042a73f.en.pdf?b8d4b7a7982532f736691c4e720110f4","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 July 2022"},{"id":232,"date":"25 July 2022","day":25,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Cross-border financial centres","authors":"Pamela Pogliani, Philip Wooldridge","abstract":"Financial centres that cater predominantly to non-residents \u2013 which we refer to as cross-border financial centres (XFCs) \u2013are important intermediaries of cross-border financial flows.

The model optimizes debt financing to trade off financing cost with refinancing risk. We show that the ECB pandemic emergency-purchase programme (PEPP) substantially improves debt sustainability for euro area sovereigns with a high debt stock. Without PEPP, debt would be on an increasing (unsustainable) trajectory with high probability, while, with asset purchases, it is sustainable and the debt ratio is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by about 2030. The improvement in debt dynamics extends beyond the PEPP and is larger for more gradual unwinding of the Central Bank balance sheet. Optimal financing under PEPP induces an extension of maturities reducing the risk without increasing costs. The analysis also shows that inflation surprises have relatively little impact on debt dynamics, with the direction and magnitude of the effect depending on the monetary policy response.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1034.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 July 2022"},{"id":236,"date":"18 July 2022","day":18,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Capital flows and monetary policy trade-offs in emerging market economies","authors":"Paolo Cavallino, Boris Hofmann","abstract":"We lay out a small open economy model incorporating key features of EME economic and financial structure: high exchange rate pass-through to import prices, low pass-through to export prices and shallow domestic financial markets giving rise to occasionally binding leverage constraints.

In the sudden stop, the central bank faces an intratemporal trade-off as output declines while inflation rises. In normal times, there is an intertemporal trade-off as the risk of a future sudden stop forces the central bank to factor financial stability considerations into its policy conduct. The optimal monetary policy leans against capital flows and domestic leverage. Macroprudential, capital flow management and central bank balance sheet policies can help to mitigate both intra- and intertemporal trade-offs. Fiscal policy also plays a key role.

Under perfect competition in goods and factor markets, pass-through of corporate taxes should be zero, and their incidence mainly falls on factor prices.

By leveraging 1,058 changes in the local business tax rate between 2013 and 2017, we find that a one percentage point tax increase results in a 0.4% increase in the retail prices of goods produced by taxed _rms and purchased by consumers in the rest of Germany, who thus end up bearing a substantial share of the tax burden. This finding suggests that manufacturers may exploit their market power to shield profits from corporate taxes, complicating the analysis of the redistributive effects of tax reforms. We also explore various dimensions of heterogeneity in pass-through related to market power, including producer size, market shares, and retail store types.

In recent years, different interpretability techniques have appeared to assist in this task, although their usefulness is still a matter of debate. In this article we contribute to the debate by creating a framework to assess the accuracy of these interpretability techniques. We start from the generation of synthetic data sets, following an approach that allows us to control the importance of each explanatory variable (feature) in our target variable. By defining the importance of features ourselves, we can then calculate to what extent the explanations given by the interpretability techniques match the underlying truth. Therefore, if in our synthetic dataset we define a feature as relevant to the target variable, the interpretability technique should also identify it as a relevant feature. We run an empirical example in which we generate synthetic datasets intended to resemble underwriting and credit rating datasets, where the target variable is a binary variable representing applicant default. We then use non-interpretable ML models, such as deep learning, to predict default, and then explain their results using two popular interpretability techniques, SHAP and permutation Feature Importance (FI). Our results using the proposed framework suggest that SHAP is better at interpreting relevant features as such, although the results may vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the ML model used. We conclude that generating synthetic datasets shows potential as a useful approach for supervisors and practitioners looking for solutions to assess the interpretability tools available for ML models in the financial sector.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2222e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 June 2022"},{"id":270,"date":"22/06/2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"A quantification of the evolution of bilateral trade flows once bilateral RTAs are implemented","authors":"Blanca Jim\xe9nez-Garc\xeda and Julio Rodr\xedguez","abstract":"In this paper we study how 103 bilateral Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) shape bilateral trade flows over time. The analysis of quarterly trade flows from 1982 Q4 to 2018 Q4 shows dynamic differences between RTAs and among trading partners. Results show that countries benefit unevenly from bilateral RTAs. The positive global trade trend since the 1990s and the negative effect of the 2008 economic crisis are captured by a factor analysis that allows us to study specifically how trade agreements affect bilateral trade asymmetrically. On average, RTAs lead to a 10% increase in bilateral trade flows above the mean trend, but disparities are found since Partial Scope Agreements (PSAs) tend to boost bilateral trade more than Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) (21% compared to 9%). However, most of the effects of PSAs occur during the first four quarters after the agreements come into force, whereas FTAs have effects over a longer period. The current study uses cluster analysis to classify bilateral trade flows into homogeneous groups according to the dynamic impact that RTAs have on them. This allows the heterogeneity between clusters to be explored. Moreover, the results show a difference relating to the economic crisis starting in 2008: in general, the impact on bilateral trade of agreements in force before 2008 is positive (30%), while it is negative for agreements signed after 2008 (-9%). This indicates that RTAs play a heterogeneous role as a cycle smoothing mechanism. Finally, there is evidence of an anticipation effect: we find that for more than half of the bilateral trade flows studied, the effect of the bilateral RTA is detected before it comes into force.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2220e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"22 June 2022"},{"id":271,"date":"22 June 2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"The effects of local demand and supply restrictions on markup","authors":"Antonio Acconcia and Elisa Scarinzi","abstract":"We investigate the causal response of markup to a contraction in local demand and supply by comparing the response to these shocks across sectors characterized by different degrees of local competition.

This paper asks how the burden of childcare affects the labor market integration of immigrants. To identify the contribution of this burden to the native-immigrant employment gap, it exploits European Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) microdata from 2004 to 2019. This survey collects information on respondents\u2019 counterfactual behaviour, in the event that: a) they had no care responsibilities; b) they could find a job compatible with their care responsibilities; c) they had access to childcare services. This information allows estimates to be obtained of the impact of childcare on labor supply comparable across eleven countries. Our results show that the burden of childcare is the major obstacle to the integration of immigrant mothers. While the employment gap between non-EU immigrant and native mothers in Northern and Southern Europe is 35 and 17 percentage points (pp) respectively, two-thirds (24 pp and 12 pp) of it is explained by childcare motivated inactivity. We reject the hypothesis that the childcare gap is solely driven by immigrants\u2019 sociodemographic traits or traditional parenting norms. Our estimates suggest that at least a quarter (5.8 pp and 2.6 pp) of the gap is due to the higher opportunity cost of paid work faced by immigrant mothers; that equal access to childcare could reduce it by 10 pp and 7 pp; and that immigrants\u2019 exclusion from flexible time arrangements could explain the larger size and higher persistence of the gap in the North.

Workhorse monetary models, which are much forward-looking, find them so effective that they run into the forward-guidance puzzle. Models that discount the future further find them much less effective, but imply that agents discount the very perception of future policy rates. This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We build on one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle (Woodford\u2019s finite planning horizons) by amending the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting. Second, we find that make-up strategies that always respond to past economic conditions, such as average inflation targeting, do too but that their stabilization benefits over IT can be reduced by the existence of the ELB.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2218e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"30 May 2022"},{"id":305,"date":"25 May 2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Covid-19 and market power in local credit markets: the role of digitalization","authors":"Thiago Christiano Silva, Sergio Rubens Stancato de Souza, Solange Maria Guerra","abstract":"This paper investigates how COVID-19 and digitalization affected the market power in local Brazilian credit markets. We first propose a novel methodology to estimate bank market power at the local level. We design a data-intensive local version of the Lerner index by developing heuristics to allocate national-level banks\' inputs, products, and costs across their branches using large-scale datasets from many sources. We then exploit the exogenous variation in COVID-19 intensity across Brazilian localities to analyze how the pandemic influenced local market power through the effective price and marginal cost channels. Despite reducing the economic activity, COVID-19 did not impact the effective price channel: bank branches offset the decrease in credit income by reducing credit concessions. However, bank branches more affected by COVID-19 experienced increased marginal costs as they could not rapidly adjust their cost factors in response to the decrease in credit concessions. Consequently, COVID-19 reduced banks\' local market power via the marginal cost channel. More digitalized bank branches enjoy cost and lending flexibility: they experience less stickiness in their cost structure and complement the reduced credit concessions in localities more affected by COVID-19 by extending credit to borrowers in remote localities less affected. Consequently, more digitalized banks improve their market power compared to traditional banks. This paper provides new insights into how crises can affect local market power in non-trivial ways.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1017.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":306,"date":"25 May 2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The limited power of monetary policy in a pandemic","authors":"Antoine Lepetit, Cristina Fuentes-Albero","abstract":"We embed an extension of the canonical epidemiology model in a New Keynesian model and analyze the role of monetary policy as a virus spreads and triggers a sizable recession. In our framework, consumption is less sensitive to real interest changes in a pandemic than in normal times because individuals have to balance the benefits of taking advantage of intertemporal substitution opportunities with the risk of becoming sick. Accommodative monetary policies such as forward guidance result in large increases in inflation but have only limited effects on real economic activity as long as the risk of infection is large. The optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is conducted optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target. However, if the lockdown policy is not optimal, the central bank faces a trade-off between its objective of stabilizing inflation and the necessity to minimize the inefficiencies associated with virus spread.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1018.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":307,"date":"25 May 2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Unconventional credit policy in an economy under zero lower bound","authors":"Jorge Pozo, Youel Rojas","abstract":"In this paper we develop a simple two-period model that reconciles credit demand and supply frictions. In this stylized but realistic model credit and deposit markets are interlinked and credit demand and credit supply frictions amplify each other in such a way that produces in equilibrium inefficiently low levels of credit and stronger reductions of the real and nominal interest rates, so an economy is much closer to the ZLB. However, an unconventional credit policy, that consists on central bank liquidity injection to banks provided they commit to issue loans (indirect central bank loans) that are guaranteed by the government, can undo partially the effects of the credit frictions and prevents the economy from reaching the ZLB. Since indirect central bank (CB) loans cannot be diverted by banks and are governmentguaranteed, credit market interventions rise aggregate credit supply and positively affect the aggregate credit demand, respectively. However, once the economy is at the ZLB the effect of a credit policy is reduced due to a relatively stronger inflation reduction, which in turn reduces entrepreneurs\' incentives to demand bank loans, and due to that the relative cost reduction from having access to cheaper indirect CB loans is smaller.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1019.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":308,"date":"20 May 2022","day":20,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The double materiality of climate physical and transition risks in the euro area","authors":"R\xe9gis Gourdel, Irene Monasterolo, Nepomuk Dunz, Andrea Mazzocchetti, Laura Parisi","abstract":"The analysis of the conditions under which, and extent to which climate-adjusted financial risk assessment affects firms\u2019 investment decisions in the low-carbon transition, and the realisation of the climate mitigation trajectories, still represent a knowledge gap.

The entity-focused regulatory paradigm is under pressure in the world of DLT-based payment arrangements where some ledgers, and thus the performance of the services as such, are distributed. DLT arrangements could provide an alternative to the traditional reliance on a mutually trusted central entity to transfer funds and enable the creation of new foundational infrastructures by distributing technical functions or linking existing systems. As such, we identify and outline concepts for use cases where DLT is potentially improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, namely a Best Execution DLT, a DLT application for a Network of Central Banks, a DLT as an AML/KYC utility, as well as DLT arrangements for an Identity Platform, a Small Payments Platform and, finally, an Interoperability Platform connecting multiple closed-loop and proprietary banking systems.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1015.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 May 2022"},{"id":310,"date":"20 May 2022","day":20,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Building regional payment areas: the Single Rule Book approach","authors":"Douglas Arner, Ross Buckley, Thomas Lammer, Dirk Zetzsche, Sangita Gazi","abstract":"In October 2020, the G20 endorsed a significant initiative to enhance cross-border payments. Faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-border payment services will deliver widespread benefits for citizens and economies worldwide, supporting economic growth, international trade, global development, and financial inclusion. Enhancing cross-border payments requires more than mere adoption of technical standards. The best outcome involves aligned technological, regulatory, and legal frameworks. This paper analyzes such payment integration projects.\\nEach border adds to the costs of a cross-border payment if crossing the border means entering into a different technological, regulatory and legal environment, with different systems, regulators, and courts. Under ideal circumstances, cross-border payments will be processed as seamlessly as comparable domestic payments, even where various currencies are processed. While this highly ambitious target is unlikely to be achieved globally in the short to medium term, regionally, the gap between cross-border and domestic payments has already been narrowed. At the global level, mismatches between the inter-institutional framework on the back-end and the contractual relationship with clients on the front-end represent potential costs for the payment services provider and increase legal risk, prompting costly legal, due diligence manual adjustments in payments processes. A high degree of cross-border harmonization via rulebooks along the technological, regulatory, and legal dimensions has been instrumental for successful regional integration projects and has promoted straight-through-processing. Potentially costly events such as rejects, returns, and revocations of payment orders have been reduced, sanction screening and financial crime compliance processes agreed.\\nDrawing on this insight, this paper suggests globally coordinated action to develop a comprehensive framework to guide and support regional payment integration. This we call a \\"Single Rule Book.\\" Such a Single Rule Book could be instrumental in enhancing safety, efficiency, and integrity in cross-border payments.

The heterogeneous nature of this model enables us to assess the effects of such experiments on the housing, rental and mortgage markets not only in the aggregate, but also at the level of individual households and sub-segments, such as first-time buyers, homeowners, buy-to-let investors, and renters. This approach can therefore offer a broad picture of the disaggregated effects of financial stability policies. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, including data from a leading UK real estate online search engine as well as loan-level regulatory data. With a series of comparative statics exercises, we investigate the impact of: i) a hard loan-to-value limit, and ii) a soft loan-to-income limit, allowing for a limited share of unconstrained new mortgages. We find that, first, these experiments tend to mitigate the house price cycle by reducing credit availability and therefore leverage. Second, an experiment targeting a specific risk measure may also affect other risk metrics, thus necessitating a careful calibration of the policy to achieve a given reduction in risk. Third, experiments targeting the owner-occupier housing market can spill over to the rental sector, as a compositional shift in home ownership from owner-occupiers to buy-to-let investors affects both the supply of and demand for rental properties.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2217e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 May 2022"},{"id":316,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"DISPERSION OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE: PASSTHROUGH, PRODUCTIVITY, AND DEMAND","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-414-dispersion-over-the-business-cycle-passthrough-productivity-and-demand.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":317,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Trading volume and liquidity provision in cryptocurreny markets","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-413-trading-volume-and-liquidity-provision-in-cryptocurreny-markets.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":318,"date":"13 May 2022","day":13,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The digital economy, privacy, and CBDC","authors":"Toni Ahnert, Peter Hoffmann, Cyril Monnet","abstract":"We study a model of financial intermediation, payment choice, and privacy in the digital economy.

Stagnation is the result of a shortage of assets that creates an oversupply of savings and puts downward pressure on the level of interest rates. Once the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate binds, the real rate cannot fully adjust downward, forcing output to fall instead. In such context, bubbles are useful as they expand the supply of assets, absorb excess savings and raise the natural interest rate - the real rate that is compatible with full employment - crowding in consumption and raising welfare. While safe bubbles are more likely to expand economic activity, riskier bubbles command a risk premium that, in equilibrium, lowers the real interest rate. A lower rate loosens borrowing constraints, potentially improving welfare when financing conditions are especially tight. Finally, fiscal policy that promises a bail-out transfer in case of a bubble collapse can support an existing bubble and improve welfare.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/bubbles-and-stagnation.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":334,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Retail CBDC and U.S. Monetary Policy Implementation: A Stylized Balance Sheet Analysis","authors":"Matthew Malloy, Francis Martinez, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Alex Thorp","abstract":"This paper discusses how a Federal Reserve issued retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) could affect U.S. monetary policy implementation.

We develop what we call the \\"Kaleckian Phillips curve\\", the slope of which is determined by the bargaining power of trade unions. We show that a nearly 90 percent reduction in inflation volatility is possible even without any changes in monetary policy when the economy transitions from equal shares of power between workers and firms to a new balance in which firms dominate.

Such a tax reform leads to expansionary long-run aggregate output and investment effects, but those are coupled with increases in wage, consumption, and income inequality. The tax reform is not self-financing and its effects depend crucially on whether the government cuts lump-sum transfers or raises distortionary labor or consumption tax rates for financing. The former results in a larger aggregate expansion, but at the expense of a greater rise in inequality. As a result, the latter is relatively more beneficial for unskilled households. We find that the tax reform, when the consumption tax rate adjusts, leads to a Pareto improvement in terms of life-time welfare. For transition dynamics, monetary policy, in addition to the fiscal adjustments, matters. In particular, if monetary policy inflates away a portion of the public debt, the economy can avoid the short-run contraction that would arise otherwise.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/macroeconomic-effects-of-capital-tax-rate-changes.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":340,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"A Parsimonious Model of Idiosyncratic Income","authors":"Edmund Crawley, Martin Blomhoff Holm, H\xe5kon Tretvoll","abstract":"The standard model of permanent and transitory income is known to be misspecified.

Bitcoin has emerged as the most popular among them, with a total valuation that reached an all-time high of $68,000 in November 2021. However, its price has historically been subject to large and abrupt fluctuations, as the sudden drop in the months that followed once again proved. Since bitcoin looks all set to continue growing while largely concentrating its activity in unregulated environments, concerns have been raised among authorities all over the world about its potential impact on financial stability, monetary policy, and the integrity of the financial system. As a result, building a sound and proper regulatory and supervisory framework to address these challenges hinges upon achieving a better understanding of both the critical underlying factors that influence the formation of bitcoin prices and the stability of such factors over time. In this article we analyse which variables determine the price at which bitcoin is traded on the most relevant exchanges. To this end, we use a flexible machine learning model, specifically a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, to establish the price of bitcoin as a function of a number of economic, technological and investor attention variables. Our LSTM model replicates reasonably well the behaviour of the price of bitcoin over different periods of time. We then use an interpretability technique known as SHAP to understand which features most influence the LSTM outcome. We conclude that the importance of the different variables in bitcoin price formation changes substantially over the period analysed. Moreover, we find that not only does their influence vary, but also that new explanatory factors often seem to appear over time that, at least for the most part, were initially unknown.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2215e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 April 2022"},{"id":346,"date":"April 2022","day":"  ","month":4,"year":2022,"title":"Spread Too Thin: The Impact of Lean Inventories","authors":"Julio L.

Recent literature embeds endogenous growth mechanisms within business cycle models to account for these \\"scarring\\" effects. The optimal conduct of monetary policy in these settings, however, remains largely unexplored. This paper augments the standard sticky-price New Keynesian (NK) to allow for endogenous dynamics in aggregate productivity. The model has a representation similar to the two-equation NK model, with an additional condition linking productivity growth to current and expected future output gaps. Absent state contingency in the subsidies that correct the externalities associated with productivity growth, optimal monetary policy sets inflation above target whenever the subsidies fall short of the externalities. In the recovery from a spell at the ZLB, the optimal discretionary policy sets inflation temporarily above target, helping mitigate the long-run damage. Following a cost-push shock that creates inflationary pressure, the central bank tolerates a larger rise in inflation than in a model with exogenous productivity. The gains from commitment include the central bank\'s ability to make credible promises about future output gaps in a way that allows it to manipulate current productivity growth.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/monetary-policy-in-a-model-of-growth.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" April 2022"},{"id":349,"date":"April 2022","day":"  ","month":4,"year":2022,"title":"Reusing Natural Experiments","authors":"Davidson Heath, Matthew C.

TALF was an unusual crisis facility because it provided loans to a wide range of nonbank financial institutions. Using detailed loan-level data unexplored by previous researchers, we study the behavior of nonbank borrowers in TALF. We find the extent to which the actions of these borrowers supported key program goals--stabilizing markets quickly, winding down the program when it was no longer needed, providing liquidity to a wide range of assets, and having borrowers internalize credit risk rather than shift it to the government--were related to institutional differences across nonbanks. Since all TALF borrowers faced the same program terms and conditions, our study is able to highlight the role of these institutional constraints.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/crisis-liquidity-facilities-with-nonbank-counterparties.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" April 2022"},{"id":351,"date":"April 2022","day":"  ","month":4,"year":2022,"title":"The Importance of Technology in Banking during a Crisis","authors":"Nicola Pierri and Yannick Timmer","abstract":"What are the implications of information technology (IT) in banking for financial stability?

As banks put more weight on mark-to-market gains, they find it optimal to refrain from revealing information about adverse shocks. Consequently, default risk is mispriced, and loan volumes, and thus investment, are not appropriately reduced. Overinvestment lowers the price of capital, leading households to increase consumption without decreasing labour supply, generating a boom. Due to mispricing, banks subsequently face bigger losses and capital depletion. Output then decreases sharply due to credit supply shortages. In a model calibrated to the US economy, these instances of market dysfunction are crucial in amplifying credit cycles.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2214e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 March 2022"},{"id":354,"date":"28/03/2022","day":28,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"The propagation of worldwide sector-specific shocks","authors":"Mario Izquierdo, Enrique Moral-Benito, Elvira Prades and Javier Quintana","abstract":"This paper analyses the aggregate impact of industry-specific shocks and their propagation through global production networks.

For that purpose, we highlight the importance of departing from standard linear models that assume unitary elasticities of substitution. We combine a theoretical framework of production networks with arbitrary elasticities of substitution (Baqaee & Farhi, 2019) and we make use of World Input-Output Database to account for international linkages. This setting illustrates how, in the presence of production input complementarities, the interaction between simultaneous shocks has significant non-linear effects on sectoral composition and aggregate output. The aggregate impact of negative (positive) shocks gets significantly amplified (mitigated) when they affect simultaneously industries with strong production linkages. Our results show that ignoring production complementarities leads to vastly underestimating the aggregate consequences of regulatory or technological shocks in industries like chemicals or vehicle manufacturing. In contrast, simultaneous shocks to services industries are well accounted for by standard measures.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2213e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 March 2022"},{"id":355,"date":"24/03/2022","day":24,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Uncertainty, non-linear contagion and the credit quality channel: an application to the Spanish interbank market","authors":"Adri\xe1n Carro and Patricia Stupariu","abstract":"Using granular data from the Spanish Central Credit Register, we study the contagion of financial distress via the credit quality channel in the Spanish interbank market.

Regarding uncertainty, we find that its effects, while smaller than those of non-linear contagion, are nonetheless relevant and most important around levels of stress at which different parts of the system become unstable. Interestingly, losses can be amplified or mitigated with respect to the deterministic case depending on the specific level of stress considered.

First, we investigate the characteristics of the various categories underlying ESG scores. Not all types of ESG categories lend themselves to more targeted strategies, which is related to both limits to ESG data disclosure and the fundamental challenge of translating qualitative characteristics into quantitative measures. Second, we consider an investment scheme based on the exclusion of firms with the lowest scores in each category of interest. In most cases, this targeted strategy still allows investors to substantially improve the portfolio headline ESG score, with only a marginal impact on financial performance relative to a broad stock market benchmark. The exclusion results in regional and sectoral biases relative to the benchmark, which may be undesirable for some investors. We then implement a \\"best-in-class\\" strategy, based on excluding firms with the lowest category scores and reinvesting the proceeds in firms with the highest scores maintaining the same regional and sectoral composition.

Incentives arise from the positive response of investors to returns achieved through cyclical risk-taking and non-linearities in the relationship between fund returns and fund flows, which may keep managers from fully internalising the effects of adverse outcomes on their portfolios. The fact that market discipline may not be sufficient to ensure prudential behaviour among managers, combined with the externalities of this risk-taking for the wider system, creates a clear case for macroprudential regulatory intervention.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2652~f8f129f758.en.pdf?5fcaa088735d7ba9b08f490f53cc651f","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 March 2022"},{"id":373,"date":"01/03/2022","day":1,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Pension Reform and Wealth Inequality: Evidence from Denmark","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-411-pension-reform-and-wealth-inequality-evidence-from-denmark.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"1 March 2022"},{"id":374,"date":"March 2022","day":"  ","month":3,"year":2022,"title":"A Journey in the History of Sovereign Defaults on Domestic-Law Public Debt","authors":"Aitor Erce, Enrico Mallucci and Mattia Picarelli","abstract":"We introduce a novel database on sovereign defaults that involve public debt instruments governed by domestic law. By systematically reviewing a large number of sources, we identify 134 default and restructuring events of domestic debt instruments, in 52 countries from 1980 to 2018. Domestic-law defaults are a global phenomenon. Over time, they have become larger and more frequent than foreign-law defaults. Domestic-law debt restructurings proceed faster than foreign ones, often through extensions of maturities and amendments to the coupon structure. While face value reductions are rare, net-present-value losses for creditors are still large. Unilateral amendments and post-default restructuring are the norm, but negotiated pre-default restructurings are becoming increasingly frequent.

The distribution of firms (1) determines which shocks are relevant for the labor market, (2) implies that wage rigidity does not significantly amplify shocks, and (3) puts discipline on the relative value of the flow opportunity cost of employment.

Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find that the manufacturing wage premium\u2014the additional pay a manufacturing worker earns relative to a comparable nonmanufacturing worker\u2014disappeared in recent years and that the erosion of the premium has primarily affected workers employed in production occupations, who experienced a wage decline of 2.5 percentage points since the 1990s relative to other workers in production occupations. While the demographic composition and other worker observables introduce level differences in manufacturing premia, our analysis suggests that they are not responsible for the declining trends. A decomposition of the premium by union membership status reveals that declines have been substantially larger across union members. To quantify the role of unionization membership on wage premia, we exploit the heterogeneity in membership status across industries within manufacturing. We find that the decline in union membership explains more than 70 percent of the decline in premia since the 1990s for union members, but the declines in unionization rates have not significantly affected non-union premia, which have instead responded to other factors, such as capital intensity.

An informational feedback loop emerges when each side underestimates the effect of its own action on the other\'s inference, possibly leading to large and persistent changes in perceived r-star disconnected from fundamentals.

The model matches remarkably well the short and long run dynamics of skilled and unskilled workers. Skill mismatch and skill-specific labour market institutions have three main effects on business cycles and growth dynamics. First, as the composition of labour market skills leads to supply segmentation, the relative scarcity of skilled workers increases the natural rate of unemployment and reduces total factor productivity with long-run effects on the growth rate of output. Second, skill heterogeneity in the labour market generates asymmetric outcomes and ampli.es measures of employment, wages and consumption inequality. Finally, the model provides important insights for the Phillips and Beveridge curves.

The paper also investigates whether public perceptions about fiscal support measures introduced during the pandemic have influenced spending behaviour. We show that simple and factual information treatments about government support policies that are communicated to random subsets of respondents can help improve consumers\u2019 perceptions about the adequacy of fiscal interventions relative to the perceptions of an untreated control group. We find evidence that this improvement in beliefs has a causal effect on consumer spending, in particular raising spending on large items like holidays and cars. Moreover, we show that such beliefs also influence household expectations about own income prospects, future access to credit and financial sentiment, while they do not affect expectations about future taxes, implying no evidence of Ricardian effects in household behaviour. We find that perceptions affect spending also among households that did not receive any government support, suggesting that fiscal interventions can have broader consequences as they influence the behaviour of groups beyond the targeted ones.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2643~3c6b864dcf.en.pdf?0a890ee98796291d75cafe7a8d2ebd8b","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 February 2022"},{"id":399,"date":"16 February 2022","day":16,"month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Unequal expenditure switching: Evidence from Switzerland","authors":"Raphael Auer, Ariel Burstein, Sarah M Lein, Jonathan Vogel","abstract":"What are the unequal effects of changes in consumer prices on the cost of living?

In total, 206,777 norms have been identified and classified. The indicators show that new sectoral regulation in Spain is increasing over time, but there are significant differences both between sectors and between Autonomous Regions. Thus, the services and agricultural sectors are relatively more frequently regulated than the industrial ones. On a temporal scale, it is possible to observe that regulators pass new regulations more frequently in downturns. This trend is particularly noticeable in 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the recreational, hospitality, commerce and textile industry sectors.

We find that both secured and unsecured money market frictions force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to de-lever, which leads to less lending and output. If the liquidity constraint is very tight, the leverage constraint may turn slack. In this case, there are large declines in lending and output.

The resulting currency mismatch causes an erosion of banks\' net worth during a devaluation, depressing credit supply. The ensuing macroeconomic downturn is amplified by a strong reduction of consumption among poorer households in response to rising borrowing costs and falling labor income. Richer households are partially insured, as they are holding a larger share of their wealth in foreign currency denominated assets.

Decomposition of the spreads into compensations for expected defaults and risk premiums shows that differential reactions of loan and bond risk premiums are the main driver of the differential spread reactions. This paper further finds that the weaker loan spread reactions to monetary policy shocks are more pronounced for riskier loans. Lastly, reactions of primary market loan spreads to monetary policy shocks are also muted. These findings highlight heterogeneous impacts of monetary policy across different types of corporate credit markets, possibly reflecting heterogeneous investor demand responses to monetary policy in those markets.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/how-does-monetary-policy-affect-prices-of-corporate-loans.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" February 2022"},{"id":426,"date":"February 2022","day":"  ","month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Revisiting the Effect of Education on Later Life Health","authors":"Avinash Moorthy, Theodore F.

Regulation in the form of a liquidity coverage requirement can be helpful in moving private sector outcomes toward a social optimum. A mandatory fee schedule also emerges as a potentially very useful tool. The structure of the optimal fee schedule depends on both the scale of volatile liabilities and the extent of \u201cliquidity coverage\u201d maintained to cover potential funding shortfalls.

To do so, we decompose the long-term interest rate into its two components: the expected shortterm interest rate and the term premium. The first component is obtained using different methodologies, two affine models and data on interest rate swaps. The second component is computed as the difference between long-term interest rates and such short-term rate. The Mexican term premium is represented by the average of the three estimations. We find that the Mexican term premium increased considerably during three episodes compared to the entire dynamics of said premium: i) the Global Financial Crisis of 2008; ii) the Taper Tantrum of 2013; and iii) the U.S. presidential election of 2016. In contrast, we find that the Mexican term premium decreased, to historically low levels, during the U.S. Quantitative Easing and Operation Twist programs. Additionally, in order to identify the main determinants that explain the behavior of this premium, we run a time varying parameters regression. In this analysis, we find that the main determinants that explain the dynamics of the premium are the compensation for FX risk (as a proxy of inflationary risk premium), the real compensation, and the U.S. term premium (as a global factor).","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work993.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 January 2022"},{"id":437,"date":"19/01/2022","day":19,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Inequality and psychological well-being in times of COVID-19: evidence from Spain","authors":"Monica Martinez-Bravo and Carlos Sanz","abstract":"Using two novel online surveys collected in May and November 2020, we study the consequences of the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic on Spanish households.

Furthermore, this drop was highly unequal: while households in the richest quintile lost 6.8% of their income, those in the poorest quintile lost 27%. We also document that the pandemic deepened the gender-income gap: on average, women experienced a three-percentage-point larger income loss than men. While this is consistent with previous findings in the literature, in this paper we document that this effect is driven by women from middle-income households with kids. Finally, we provide evidence that Spanish individuals experienced moderate declines in their levels of psychological well-being.
