We use a deep RL (DRL) approach (DDPG) in an RBC macroeconomic model. We set up two learning scenarios, one of which is deterministic without the technological shock and the other is stochastic. The objective of the deterministic environment is to compare the learning agent\'s behavior to a deterministic steady-state scenario. We demonstrate that in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios, the agent\'s choices are close to their optimal value. We also present cases of unstable learning behaviours.

This paper constructs an alternative measure, the weighted median inflation rate, for 38 advanced and emerging economies using subclass level disaggretion of the CPI over 1990-2021, and compares the properties of this measure to those of standard core. For quarterly data, we find that the weighted median is less volatile than standard core, more closely related to economic slack, and more closely related to headline inflation over the next year. The weighted median also has a drawback: in most countries, it has a lower average level than headline inflation. We therefore also consider a measure of core inflation that eliminates this bias, which is based on the percentile of sectoral inflation rates that matches the sample average of headline CPI inflation.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/02/24/Weighted-Median-Inflation-Around-the-World-A-Measure-of-Core-Inflation-530171","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 February 2023"},{"id":3,"date":"February 24, 2023","day":24,"month":2,"year":2023,"title":"Global Supply Chain Disruptions: Challenges for Inflation and Monetary Policy in Sub-Saharan Africa","authors":"Zo Andriantomanga, Marijn Bolhuis, Shushanik Hakobyan","abstract":"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a large disruption of global supply chains.

Our findings suggest that central banks can stabilize inflation and output more efficiently by monitoring global supply chains and adjusting the monetary policy stance before the disruptions have fully passed through into all inflation components.

The effects of these shocks on industrial production and GDP are recovered through a combination of local projection methods and the input-output framework in Acemoglu et al. (2016). In the second approach, we use the IMF\u2019s G20 model to gauge the importance of supply shocks in jointly driving activity and inflation surprises.

Using the case of the Greek capital controls in 2015, the events around which led to a massive loss of confidence in the domestic banking system, we show that firms whose operations were more dependent on domestic banks suffered a steep decline in imports and, subsequently, exports. This operated through letters of credit, which during the capital controls period had to be backed by firms\u2019 own cash collateral rather than the bank guarantee. As a result, cash-poor firms imported relatively less.

Asset-pricing theory suggests that real house prices respond to changes in real interest rates in a non-linear fashion. This non-linearity should be especially pronounced at very low real interest rates. Most existing empirical studies estimate models with a con-stant semi-elasticity, thereby ruling out by design the potential non-linearities between house prices and interest rates. To address this issue, we estimate a panel model for the euro area countries with a constant interest rate elasticity (as opposed to a constant semi-elasticity), which is consistent with asset pricing theory. Our empirical results suggest that, in a low interest rate environment such as the period between 2015 and 2021, non-linearities in the house price response to interest rate changes are important: an increase of real interest rates from ultra-low levels could lead to downward pressure on real house prices three to eight times higher than the literature suggests.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2789~9e79458ee5.en.pdf?9cf1e4ed8f973f4e55fa2ffc9db60084","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 February 2023"},{"id":10,"date":"23 February 2023","day":23,"month":2,"year":2023,"title":"The shape of business cycles: a cross-country analysis of Friedman\'s plucking theory","authors":"Emanuel Kohlscheen, Richhild Moessner, Daniel Rees","abstract":"We test the international applicability of Friedman\'s famous plucking theory of the business cycle in 12 advanced economies between 1970 and 2021.

Convergence to the two-cycle occurs for the intermediate parameter range, while the extreme scenarios of both a simple, stable two-cycle and highly nonlinear dynamics (chaos) lead to coordination on the steady state in the lab.

This finding also persists in the learning-to-optimize design. Finally, convergence in the learning-to-optimize experiment is more challenging to achieve: coordination on the two-cycle is never observed, although the two-cycle Pareto dominates the steady state.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/2/staff-working-paper-2023-13","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"21 February 2023"},{"id":15,"date":"20 February 2023","day":20,"month":2,"year":2023,"title":"Evaluating the impact of dividend restrictions on euro area bank market values","authors":"Desislava Andreeva, Paul Bochmann, Julius Schneider","abstract":"This paper evaluates the impact of the March 2020 European Central Bank recommenda-tion that banks do not pay dividends or buy back shares on their market values.

It uses the ACCL model, particularly adapted to quantify the consequences of energy price shocks and technology improvements on CO2 emissions, temperature changes, climate damage and GDP. Our simulations show that without climate policies, i.e. a \u2018business as usual\u2019 scenario, the warming may be +4 to +5\xb0C in 2100, with considerable climate damage. We also find that an acceleration in \u2018usual technical progress\u2019 - not targeted at reducing greenhouse gas intensity - makes global warming and climate damage worse than the \u2018business as usual\u2019 scenario. According to our estimates, the world does not achieve climate goals in 2100 without technological changes to avoid CO2 emissions. To hit such climatic targets, intervening only through the relative price of different energy types, e.g. via a carbon tax, requires challenging hypotheses of international coordination and price increase for polluting energies. We assess a multi-lever climate strategy, associating diverse price and technology measures. This mix combines energy efficiency gains, carbon sequestration, and a decrease of 3% per year in the relative price of non-carbon-emitting electricity with a 1 to 1.5% annual rise in the relative price of our four polluting energy sources (corresponding to a relatively low but achievable carbon tax scenario). None of these components alone is sufficient to reach climate objectives.

Zolt","abstract":"Personal income taxes (PITs) play little or no role in the Middle East and North Africa, often yielding less than 2 percent of GDP in revenue\u2014with the exception of few North African countries. This paper examines how PITs have evolved in recent decades, and what they might look like in the next 20 years. Top marginal tax rates on labor and business income of individuals have declined substantially, a trend that mirrors reductions in advanced and developing economies. Taxation of passive capital income has changed very little, and the revenue intake from this source remains low throughout the region (less than 1 percent of GDP on average and concentrated in oil-importing non-fragile states). Social security contributions (SSC) have increased in importance in nearly all MENA countries, and some countries have introduced additional payroll taxes. The combination of reduced marginal tax rates, light taxation of income from capital and business activities, and increase of SSC, have resulted in income tax systems that create disincentives to work and incentives for informality, and contribute little to government revenue and income redistribution. Given differences in economic and political structures, demographics, and starting points, the path to PIT/SSC reforms will vary across the region. Countries with relatively mature PIT/SSC systems, where revenue performance has improved in the past two decades, will increasingly need to balance the revenue and equity objectives against effciency objectives (in particular labor market incentives and infromality). Countries with no PITs will have to weigh whether a consumption tax/SSC system that mimic a flat tax on labor income is sufficient to diversify revenue away from oil and whether to adopt PITs to address rising income and wealth inequality. Finally, fragile states, who face more political volatility and weaker fiscal institutions, will have to focus on simplicity of tax design and collection to be able to raise revenue from PITs.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/02/17/Personal-Income-Taxes-in-the-Middle-East-and-North-Africa-Prospects-and-Possibilities-529963","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 February 2023"},{"id":21,"date":"February 17, 2023","day":17,"month":2,"year":2023,"title":"Bubble Detective: City-Level Analysis of House Price Cycles","authors":"Serhan Cevik, Sadhna Naik","abstract":"This paper investigates house price dynamics at high frequency using city-level observations during the period 1994-2022 in Lithuania.

Focusing on emerging economies, we show how slight changes in the filtering approach of fiscal forecast errors or the accumulation procedure of responses can significantly impact estimates.

This generalized dynamic IS curve sheds light on several new factors that shape the dependence of aggregate demand on interest rates. In particular, interest rates are discounted in investment and aggregate demand if and only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption (IES) is low enough, and compounded if it is higher. The addition of household heterogeneity can generate discounting in aggregate consumption as well, in a new way that does not rely on precautionary savings. Instead, household heterogeneity creates discounting by making consumption respond to interest rates primarily as a ripple effect of the response of investment, not through intertemporal substitution.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/dynamic-curve-when-there-both-investment-and-savings","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 January 2023"},{"id":95,"date":"24/01/2023","day":24,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Trust and accountability in times of pandemic","authors":"Monica Martinez-Bravo and Carlos Sanz","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic took place against the backdrop of growing political polarization and distrust in political institutions in many countries.

The results are robust to selection of alternative variables representing these motivations.

The large drop in F-type output when emissions intensity rises might signal their enhanced ability to relocate the production of high-carbon footprints intermediates to non-regulated regions. Outsourcing helps dodging the EU green regulation and the strategy becomes increasingly appealing as the sectoral coverage of the ETS is extended.

It mainly focuses on Japan after the collapse of its bubble economy, European countries after the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crises, China under debt expansion, and developed countries during the spread of COVID-19. We also identify so-called \\"zombie firms,\\" which survive with banks\' and governments\' support despite performing poorly without the prospect of recovery, using firms\' financial data. We set the criteria of the zombie firms by arranging methodologies proposed by the existing studies. The analysis shows that the number of zombie firms surged after the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990s in Japan. It decreased in the early 2000s and remained relatively lower in recent years for both large and small-and-medium enterprises. At least based on the currently available data in fiscal 2020 after the spread of COVID-19, we do not detect a problematic growth in the number of zombie firms as in the 1990s.

We begin by documenting that, in a panel of 53 countries, central bank holdings of dollar reserves are significantly correlated with the dollar-denominated bank borrowing of their non-financial corporate sectors, controlling for a number of known covariates of reserve accumulation. We then build a model in which the central bank can deal with private-sector mismatch, and the associated risk of a domestic financial crisis, in two ways: (i) by imposing ex ante financial regulations such as bank capital requirements; or (ii) by building a stockpile of dollar reserves that allow it to serve as an ex post dollar lender of last resort. The model highlights a novel externality: individual central banks may tend to over-accumulate dollar reserves, relative to what a global planner would choose. This is because individual central banks do not internalize that their hoarding of reserves exacerbates a global scarcity of dollar-denominated safe assets, which lowers dollar interest rates and encourages firms to increase the currency mismatch of their liabilities. Relative to the decentralized outcome, a global planner may prefer stricter financial regulation (e.g., higher bank capital requirements) and reduced holdings of dollar reserves.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/01/18/Central-Banks-as-Dollar-Lenders-of-Last-Resort-Implications-for-Regulation-and-Reserve-528317","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 January 2023"},{"id":113,"date":"17/01/2023","day":17,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"New supply bottlenecks index based on newspaper data","authors":"Pablo Burriel, Iv\xe1n Kataryniuk, Carlos Moreno P\xe9rez and Francesca Viani","abstract":"We develop a new monthly indicator of supply bottlenecks using newspaper articles.

Overall, the evidence points to expansionary monetary policy decreasing capital misallocation mainly through the relaxation of financial frictions of incumbent, productive, constrained firms.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2302e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 January 2023"},{"id":118,"date":"13 January 2023","day":13,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Monetary policy and credit card spending","authors":"Francesco Grigoli, Damiano Sandri","abstract":"We analyze the impact of monetary policy on consumer spending using confidential credit card data.

Since there is not much difference, on average, between IT and non-IT countries in mean inflation, inflation volatility and the extent of inflation anchoring, it is not easy to sort out what role IT has played in ensuring good outcomes; in particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that the success of IT may be due to \u2018regression to the mean\u2019.

Forceful fiscal responses have prevented an otherwise sharper contraction. Many countries introduced or expanded job-retention schemes to preserve jobs and support households. This paper uses a microsimulation approach (EUROMOD) and household data to assess the effectiveness of those schemes in stabilizing household income during the pandemic across European countries. Empirical evidence shows that job-retention schemes were effective in stabilizing income and, along with other measures, absorbed nearly 80 percent of market income shocks\u2014almost doubling the extent of the automatic stabilization of the pre-pandemic tax and benefit systems. The large effects are related to the widespread use and scaling up of those schemes and a deep but short-lived disruption to labor markets during the pandemic. Along with other fiscal support measures, job-retention schemes helped mitigate the rise in the unemployment rate, by about 3 percentage points, and income inequality during the pandemic. Our results show that job-retention schemes were largely targeted, in which households more vulnerable to income losses, such as lower-income families, youth, and low-skilled workers, are able to stabilize their income.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/01/13/How-Effective-were-Job-Retention-Schemes-during-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-A-Microsimulation-528066","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 January 2023"},{"id":121,"date":"January 13, 2023","day":13,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Coming Clean on Your Taxes","authors":"Sebastian Beer, Ruud A.

A VDP can then only be beneficial if tax evasion induces an external social cost beyond the direct revenue foregone, e.g., due to adverse effects on overall tax morale.

We then use the U.S. household-level data to quantify the effect of the house price change on housing affordability relative to that of the interest rate change.

Using administrative data from the UK, the paper finds that the choice of fixation length tracks the life-cycle decline of credit risk in the mortgage market: the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio decreases and collateral coverage improves over the life of the loan due to principal repayment and house price appreciation. High-LTV borrowers, who pay large initial credit spreads, trade off their insurance motive against reducing credit spreads over time using shorter-term contracts. To quantify demand for long-term contracts, I develop a life-cycle model of optimal mortgage fixation choice. With baseline house price growth and interest rate risk, households prefer shorter-term contracts at high LTV levels, and longer-term contracts once LTV is sufficiently low, in line with the data. The mechanism helps explain reduced and heterogeneous demand for long-term mortgage contracts.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk//working-paper/2023/the-demand-for-long-term-mortgage-contracts-and-the-role-of-collateral","centralbank":"Bank of England","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"6 January 2023"},{"id":132,"date":"05/01/2023","day":5,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Evaluating central bank asset purchases in a term structure model with a forward-looking supply factor","authors":"Juan Equiza, Ricardo Gimeno, Antonio Moreno and Carlos Thomas","abstract":"The theoretical literature on term structure models emphasises the importance of the expected absorption of duration risk during the residual life of term bonds in order to understand the yield curve effect of central banks\u2019 government bond purchases.

The simulation procedure, though demonstrated in the realm of payments systems, has tremendous potential for helping with data-deficient problems where only high-level aggregate information is available. The approach uses the concept of integer composition in combinatorics to break down the daily total value and volume (available) into individual data points (unavailable) throughout the day. The algorithm also introduces a technique to incorporate any intraday timing pattern (known or hypothetical) to make simulated data closer to reality. Simulation results show that the probability distribution of individual payment values is remarkably stable through repeated random sampling. This suggests a high degree of accuracy and viability of this simulation method. In addition, the densities of simulated intraday transactions are found to be invariably skewed to the left of the mean payment value, which reflects the nature of retail payments systems.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/1/staff-working-paper-2023-1","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 January 2023"},{"id":136,"date":"03/01/2023","day":3,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"The forgotten lender: the role of multilateral lenders in sovereign debt and default","authors":"Mar\xeda Bru Mu\xf1oz","abstract":"The role of multilateral lenders in sovereign default has been traditionally overlooked by the literature.

In the following months, however, economic activity remained sluggish while equity markets bounced back. This disconnect between equity values and macro-variables can be partially explained by other factors, namely the decline in risk-free interest rates, and -for the US- the strong profitability of the IT sector. As a result, an econometrician forecasting economic activity with aggregate stock market variables during the Covid-crisis is likely to get poor results. Our main contribution is thus to rely on sectorally disaggregated equity variables within a factor model in order to predict US economic activity. We find, first, that the factor model better predicts future economic activity compared to aggregate equity variables, or to conventional benchmarks used in the literature, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Second, we show that the strong performance of the factor model comes from the fact that it filters out the \u201cexpected returns\u201d component of the sectoral equity variables as well as the foreign component of aggregate future cash flows. The constructed factor overweights upstream and \u201cvalue\u201d sectors that are found to be closely linked to the future state of the business cycle.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/macroeconomic-forecasting-using-filtered-signals-stock-market-cross-section","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 December 2022"},{"id":140,"date":"28 december 2022","day":28,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Paying in a blink of an eye: it hurts less, but you spend more","authors":"Marie-Claire Broekhoff, Carin van der Cruijsen","abstract":"","linkarticle":"https://www.dnb.nl/publicaties/publicaties-onderzoek/working-paper-2022/760-paying-in-a-blink-of-an-eye-it-hurts-less-but-you-spend-more/","centralbank":"De Nederlandsche Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 December 2022"},{"id":141,"date":"12/27/2022","day":27,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Time-Consistent Implementation in Macroeconomic Games","authors":"By Barth\xe9lemy Jean, Mengus Eric","abstract":"The commitment ability of governments is neither infinite nor zero but intermediate.

Conditional on large disagreement about the economic outlook, higher Twitter traffic is associated with smaller monetary policy surprises, suggesting that exchanging private signals among investors can help improve expectations.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/information-acquisition-ahead-monetary-policy-announcements","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 December 2022"},{"id":155,"date":"20 december 2022","day":20,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Who participates in the credit market during the COVID-19 pandemic?

We compare the cyclicality of the fiscal stance, measured as the change in the cyclically-adjusted total and primary budget balance, established during budgetary planning with their ex-post outturns. We find empirical evidence for pro-cyclical fiscal plans and a more a-cyclical behaviour of fiscal outcomes on average for euro area countries. We show hence that the tendency to run a pro-cyclical policy is already anchored in fiscal plans and not just an outcome of surprises on cyclical conditions. This result is robust to different specifications and estimation methods. We observe pro-cyclicality at budget planning especially during tightening episodes and a more a-cyclical fiscal stance during fiscal loosening. We also find that fiscal plans are pro-cyclical outside of crisis years of the Global Financial crisis and the European Debt crisis. We detect strong country heterogeneity in the orientation of fiscal policy ex-ante and ex-post in the euro area.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/fiscal-policy-orientation-euro-area-real-time","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 December 2022"},{"id":158,"date":"19 December 2022","day":19,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Measuring the effects of bank remuneration rules: evidence from the UK","authors":"By Ieva Sakalauskaite and Qun Harris","abstract":"In this paper, we study whether and how some of the remuneration rules introduced after the\xa0Global Financial Crisis affected bankers\u2019 compensation using a unique regulatory dataset on\xa0remuneration in six major UK banks during 2014\u201319.

The results show that banks mainly respond to higher SII buffers by increasing their equity, as intended by the regulators.

The second is a neglect of expectations data driven by a strong belief that inflation expectations were firmly anchored and so inflation increases would be temporary.

Similar evidence holds for campaign contributions and board connections. The increase in the amount of contracts obtained is observed primarily for firms that had limited ability to efficiently support Pentagon efforts, and when contracts received less scrutiny.

It usually comes with the qualifier \u201cdisruptive\u201d. Thus, the hype is easy to understand: fintech would upend the financial system due to its disruptive nature, as it would allow financial services to be completed faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. Indeed, many have predicted that the remittances market was on the verge of being disrupted as remittances are considered too costly while remittance service providers inefficient, opaque, and outdated. Therefore, there seems to be no better setting for assessing the allegedly disruptive effects of fintech. Against that background, this paper investigates how those predictions have fared so far. Contrary to expectations, it found that instead of disrupting incumbents fintechs have increasingly been entangled with them.

Not all gender gaps necessarily reflect gender inequality as some gender gaps are not driven by the lack of equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities bywomen and girls, and this has important implications on policy designs to address gender inequity. However, the literature has paid little attention to this issue, often using gender inequality and gender gaps interchangeably; (ii) the evolving focus of gender inequality suggests there is still a long way to go to fully address gender inequality. Particularly gender inequality is taking more subtle and implicit forms, though the social and economic benefits from addressing the remaininggender inequality is still likely to be substantial; (iii) addressing gender inequality benefits everyone, not just women. Thus, the entire society should work together, even for each individual\u2019s own interest; (iv) both general policies and targeted gender policies can help address gender inequality.However, as gender inequality becomes more subtle and implicit, targeted gender policies will likely need to play an increasing role, which also makes separating gender inequality from gender gaps all that more important; and (v) addressing gender inequality does not need to start with policies targeted at its root causes, but needs to end with eliminating the root causes. Only then, any remaining gender gaps would only reflect preference and comparative advantage between men and women. The paper concludes by discussing gaps in the literature and policy challenges going forward.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/12/02/Tackling-Gender-Inequality-Definitions-Trends-and-Policy-Designs-525751","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 December 2022"},{"id":206,"date":"December 2, 2022","day":2,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Show Me the Money: Tracking Consumer Spending with Daily Card Transaction Data During the Pandemic","authors":"Serhan Cevik","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented shock to economic activity with abrupt and unexpected changes in household consumption behavior.

Bennett","abstract":"On 28 August 1833 Parliament passed legislation that abolished slavery within the British Empire, emancipating more than 800,000 enslaved Africans. As part of the compromise that helped to secure abolition, the British government agreed a generous compensation package of \xa320 million to slave-owners for the loss of their \u2018property\u2019. The Bank of England administered the payment of slavery compensation on behalf of the British government. Using records held in the Bank\u2019s Archive, a data set of 13,500 unique transactions has been produced which details the collection of \xa33.4 million of compensation awarded in the form of government stock (3.5% Reduced Annuities). We shed new light on the compensation process by deploying this data set to analyse who actually held the Reduced Annuities in the books of the Bank of England, and for how long the stock was kept. While slave-owners were the main beneficiaries of the compensation process, our analysis shows that there were also other groups who gained through their roles as intermediaries. These agents sought to profit from the business opportunity presented by the moment of compensation in the mid-1830s by facilitating the collection of compensation awards on behalf of slave-owners and charging commission fees for their services. The results show that just 10 individual account names had over 8,000 transactions totalling \xa32.2 million. The largest agents were partners in London banks and merchant firms that had pre-existing commercial ties to the colonies that received compensation in Reduced Annuities (Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and the Virgin Islands). Our analysis also shows that this stock was quickly sold, meaning that compensation awards made in Reduced Annuities were converted into cash. By 1844, almost none of the \xa33.4 million in compensation was still held as Reduced Annuities by those to whom it had been awarded, or by those who had collected it. All of this provides further evidence for the strong links between financial institutions in the City of London, the capital generated through the transatlantic slavery economy, and the compensation process during the 1830s.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk//working-paper/2022/the-collection-of-slavery-compensation-1835-43","centralbank":"Bank of England","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 November 2022"},{"id":216,"date":"23/11/2022","day":23,"month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Richer earnings dynamics, consumption and portfolio choice over the life cycle","authors":"Julio G\xe1lvez and Gonzalo Paz-Pardo","abstract":"Households face earnings risk which is non-normal and varies by age and over the income distribution.

Perhaps surprisingly, only a small minority of such episodes were followed by sustained acceleration in wages and prices. Instead, inflation and nominal wage growth tended to stabilize, leaving real wage growth broadly unchanged. A decomposition of wage dynamics using a wage Phillips curve suggests that nominal wage growth normally stabilizes at levels that are consistent with observed inflation and labor market tightness. When focusing on episodes that mimic the recent pattern of falling real wages and tightening labor markets, declining inflation and nominal wage growth increases tended to follow \u2013 thus allowing real wages to catch up.

In these circumstances, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) may be used to provide competitive pressure to drive up deposit rates and improve monetary policy transmission. We explore the implications of two design features: interest rate and convenience value. Increasing the CBDC interest rate past a point where it becomes a binding floor, increases deposit rates but leads to greater inequality of market shares in both deposit and lending markets and can reduce the responsiveness of deposit rates to changes in the IOR rate. In contrast, increasing convenience, from sufficiently high levels, increases deposit rates, causes market shares to converge and can increase the responsiveness of deposit rates to changes in the IOR rate.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1046.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 November 2022"},{"id":256,"date":"2022-11-07","day":7,"month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Fiscal Policy in the Age of COVID-19: Does It \u201cGet in All of the Cracks\u201d?","authors":"Gourinchas, Pierre-Olivier, Kalemli-\xd6zcan, \u015eebnem, Penciakova, Veronika, Sander, Nicholas","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused an uncommon recession that required uniquely large and often novel fiscal responses. Government-imposed lockdowns created severe supply bottlenecks in some sectors of the economy, and physical distancing led to dramatic changes in patterns of consumer spending. Some sectors of the economy\u2014such as online retail\u2014benefited, while many others\u2014such as restaurants and travel\u2014struggled to deal with losses of customers and the constraints of lockdowns and remote work. In reaction to this, many governments quickly implemented large fiscal support packages for households and firms.\\nIn this paper, we investigate whether fiscal policy was able to protect firms from failure and stimulate activity in sectors of the economy with slack. We apply two frameworks to the separate questions of (i) did fiscal policy appropriately support firms and (ii) did fiscal policy support economic activity globally? For our first framework, we use firm-level balance-sheet data and a structural model to estimate how firms\u2019 cash flow evolved during the pandemic. In our second framework, we model the global production network using data on 65 countries and 35 sectors. We then investigate to what extent global fiscal stimulus helped countries and their neighbours stimulate economic activity in response to the pandemic.\\nWe find that without any support, an additional 9% of firms would have failed in 2020, but government support to firms lowered that to 4.3%. In advanced economies, support was sufficiently large that failure rates were 0.47% below a typical year, whereas in emerging-market economies (EMEs), which implemented smaller fiscal packages, an additional 9.28% of firms failed even with fiscal support. At the macro level, we find that 70% of sectors in the global economy face supply bottlenecks created by the pandemic and as such, cannot be stimulated with fiscal policy. Nonetheless, fiscal policy was able to redirect spending to the remaining sectors of the economy and eliminated slack in 10% of the economy. We find that fiscal spillovers between countries are small, which suggests that continued fiscal support in advanced economies poses headwinds to EMEs as global rates and risk premiums rise.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/11/staff-working-paper-2022-45","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 November 2022"},{"id":257,"date":"November 4, 2022","day":4,"month":11,"year":2022,"title":"A Multi-Currency Exchange and Contracting Platform","authors":"Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Tommaso Mancini Griffoli, Robert Townsend, Nicolas Zhang","abstract":"Cross-border payments can be slow, expensive, and risky.

The findings suggest that cost reductions have a short-term positive impact on remittances, that dissipates beyond one quarter. According to our estimates, reducing transaction costs to the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 percent could generate an additional  US$32bn in remittances, higher that the direct cost savings from lower transaction costs, thus suggesting an absolute elasticity greater than one. Among remittance cost-mitigation factors, higher competition in the remittance market, a deeper financial sector, and  adequate correspondent banking relationships are associated with a lower elasticity of remittance to transaction costs. Similarly, remittance cost-adaptation factors such as enhanced transparency in remittance costs, improved financial literary and higher ICT development coincide with remittances being less sensitive to transaction costs. Supplementing the panel analysis, the use of micro data from the USA-Mexico corridor confirm that migrants facing higher transaction costs tend to remit less, and that this effect is less pronounced for skilled migrants and those that have access to a bank account.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/11/04/How-Do-Transaction-Costs-Influence-Remittances-525067","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 November 2022"},{"id":261,"date":"03 november 2022","day":3,"month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Nowcasting GDP using machine learning methods","authors":"Dennis Kant, Andreas Pick, Jasper de Winter","abstract":"","linkarticle":"https://www.dnb.nl/publicaties/publicaties-onderzoek/working-paper-2022/754-nowcasting-gdp-using-machine-learning-methods/","centralbank":"De Nederlandsche Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 November 2022"},{"id":262,"date":"October 28, 2022","day":28,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"Monetary Policy Communication and Financial Markets in India","authors":"Faisal Ahmed, Mahir Binici, Jarkko Turunen","abstract":"Forward-looking monetary policy communication has become a key element of flexible inflation-targeting regimes across advanced and emerging market economies.

I show that a 10% increase in bank exposure to the tax significantly increases disparities in the growth of total loans between small and large firms by 1.6 percentage points. When accounting for firms switching to soles financing from different banks, the effect on large firms\u2019 debt is only compositional. Using a confidential dataset on the universe of FX derivative contracts, I show that firms that are mostly affected by the policy are not hedged through FX derivatives. Additional findings using survey data suggest that this policy has potential heterogeneous implications for firms\u2019 real outcomes.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2236e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"21 October 2022"},{"id":278,"date":"10/21/2022","day":21,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"Joint Ownership of Production Projects as a Commitment Device against Interest Groups","authors":"By Berardi Nicoletta, Seabright Paul","abstract":"This paper investigates an unexplored rationale for joint ownership of a production project.

In particular, after an increase in the policy rate, the model predicts that loan rates and default probabilities increase in both sectors. Highly capitalized banks with a riskier portfolio are more sensitive because the risk-weighted capital constraint affects them more, so they contract lending more.

Our work finds strong evidence that cap-and-trade schemes are associated with larger volatility in CPI headline inflation, while no significant effect is found in the case of carbon taxes. This effect seems to feed only through the energy component, and does not seem to affect the volatility of core inflation. In addition, we find that under cap-and-trade schemes, both the increase in the underlying price of emissions and the expansion in the activities covered by these initiatives are associated with greater inflation volatility. These findings have important policy implications, given that inflation volatility could complicate the conduct of monetary policy. Since the ambition to mitigate climate change in the years to come is expected to be implemented through broader coverage of carbon pricing, central banks should monitor those developments closely.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2231e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 October 2022"},{"id":300,"date":"03 October 2022","day":3,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"The scarring effects of deep contractions","authors":"David Aikman, Mathias Drehmann, Mikael Juselius, Xiaochuan Xing","abstract":"We find that deep contractions have highly persistent scarring effects, depressing the level of GDP at least a decade hence.

We assess the likely revenue impact of various tax policy changes based on a sample of 21 advanced and emerging market economies, using granular information from the IMF Tax Policy Reform Database v.4.0. Our findings suggest that the revenue yield of a tax policy change varies significantly depending on the tax instrument adopted (e.g., VAT or personal income tax) and the nature of the change (i.e., rate, base). For example, in our sample, base-broadening changes to personal and corporate income taxes as well as to excise and property taxes have generally a more significant and long-lasting revenue yields than rate changes. By contrast, rate changes appear to have a relatively more significant revenue impact in the case of VAT and social security contributions. We also observe an asymmetry in the revenue impact of most tax policy measures when controlling for the direction of tax changes (i.e., its significance varies depending on whether taxes are increased or decreased).

Simulations show that, in the absence of supervisory sector-wide recommendations to suspend dividend payouts, banks would likely have reduced the payouts only slightly in the first year of the pandemic.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/09/23/Why-European-Banks-Adjust-their-Dividend-Payouts-522761","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 September 2022"},{"id":327,"date":"September 23, 2022","day":23,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Keeping it Simple\u2013Efficiency Costs of Fixed Margin Regimes in Transfer Pricing","authors":"Sebastian Beer, Sebastien Leduc, Jan Loeprick","abstract":"Simplifying tax policy comes with costs and benefits. This paper explores simplification options for the taxation of MNEs, an area where administrative and compliance costs of the current rules are large. Simplified approaches seek to reduce these costs by relying on an approximation of the true tax base, potentially distorting resource allocation. We examine the efficiency cost of transfer pricing simplification theoretically and empirically. Using a sample of 300,000 firms located in 22 countries, we estimate that common transfer pricing practices reduce efficiency between 0.25 and 2.2 percent of total factor productivity across sectors. Focusing on the manufacturing sector, we then observe that simplification more than doubles sectoral inefficiency on average.

Why might central banks want to look through supply-driven inflation sometimes and pivot away at other times? When does a change in monetary policy stance help anchor expectations? When is a strong monetary policy tightening compatible with a soft landing? In this paper we present a simple environment that helps clarify these issues by offering an optimal policy perspective on recent central bank behaviour. In particular, we examine optimal policy in an environment where there is a risk of wage-price spirals and where the central bank views wage- and price-setters as having bounded rationality.

Then, by the 1940s, central banks turned into de facto development banks under the aegis of governments, sawing the seeds for high inflation. It took the high inflation episodes of the 1970s and 1980s and the associated major decline in real income, and growing social discontent, to grant central banks political and operational independence to focus on fighting inflation starting in the 1990s. The empirical evidence confirms the strong negative association between central bank independence and inflation and finds that improvements in independence result in a steady decline in inflation.

Estimation using firm-level data suggest that, at present, locations of excess profit across countries are consistent with profit shifting practices by multinationals. Destination-based EPTs can address this concern. Estimates suggest that a 10 percent EPT on the globally consolidated accounts of multinationals (on top of the current corporate income tax), with the EPT base being allocated using sales, raises global revenue by 16 percent of corporate income tax revenues. The analysis suggests that international coordination would be desirable to mitigate the risks of profit shifting and tax competition. Eventually, EPTs could mark an evolution of corporate taxation toward a non-distortionary rent tax.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/09/16/Excess-Profit-Taxes-Historical-Perspective-and-Contemporary-Relevance-523550","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 September 2022"},{"id":351,"date":"September 16, 2022","day":16,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Structural Reforms and Economic Growth: A Machine Learning Approach","authors":"Anil Ari, Gabor Pula, Liyang Sun","abstract":"The qualitative and granular nature of most structural indicators and the variety in data sources poses difficulties for consistent cross-country assessments and empirical analysis.

Moreover, both instruments lead to a compositional shift in lending: the loan-to-value policy from first-time buyers to buy-to-let investors and the loan-to-income policy from both first-time buyers and home movers to buy-to-let investors.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2230e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 September 2022"},{"id":354,"date":"15 September 2022","day":15,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Uncovering the network structure of non-centrally cleared derivative markets: evidences from regulatory data","authors":"Sebastiano Michele Zema","abstract":"The network structure of non-centrally cleared derivative markets, uncovered via the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), is investigated with a focus on the Covid-19 market turmoil period.

Banks adjust their credit supply only if the capital relief is permanent or implemented through established processes that foresee long release periods. By contrast, discretionary relief measures are met with limited success, possibly owing to the uncertainty surrounding their capital replenishment path.

This paper estimates the portfolio overlap - which we define as the correlation of changes in the market value of securities portfolios - between global investment funds and Japanese financial institutions in the last two decades and studies the time series properties and the financial stability implications. There are three main findings. First, the number of financial institutions with a high portfolio overlap with investment funds has increased since before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The increase is particularly prominent for the portfolio overlap between bond funds and regional banks. Second, financial institutions with lower capital ratios, loan-to-deposit ratios, lending margins tend to have a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds. Third, financial institutions with a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds tend to see a larger decline in the market value of the securities portfolio in response to global market shocks such as redemption waves to investment funds, rises in U.S. interest rates, or disruptions in the U.S. bond market. Our results indicate that as secular changes in structural factors such as a decline in the potential growth rate of the home country weigh on the long-term profitability, Japanese financial institutions in particular regional banks have increased investment in foreign securities, making themselves susceptible to global market shocks that arise from the activities of global investment funds even without direct exposure to these funds. Moreover, an increase in the number of financial institutions with a higher portfolio overlap suggests that the impact of such a global market shock may extend over wide areas of the domestic financial system.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e15.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 September 2022"},{"id":357,"date":"14 September 2022","day":14,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Immigrants and the distribution of income and wealth in the euro area: first facts and implications for monetary policy","authors":"Maarten Dossche, Aleksandra Kolndrekaj, Maximilian Propst, Javier Ramos Perez, Jiri Slacalek","abstract":"We use household surveys to describe differences in wages, income, wealth and liquid assets of households born in their country of residence (\u201cnatives\u201d) vs. those born in other EU and non-EU countries (\u201cimmigrants\u201d).

Central banks see phishing and social engineering as the most common methods of attack, and the potential losses from a systemically relevant cyber attack are deemed to be large, especially if the target is a big tech providing critical cloud infrastructures.

To do this, I study the macroeconomic consequences of government-administered interest rates in the neoclassical real business cycle model. When the government has the power to fix the safe real interest rate, the gap between the `sticky real safe rate\' and the `neutral rate\' can generate far-reaching aggregate distortions. When fear exogenously rises, the demand for safe assets rise and the neutral rate falls. If the central bank does not lower the safe rate by the same amount, savings rise leading to a decline in consumption and aggregate demand. The same mechanism works in reverse, when fear falls. Quantitatively, I show that a single fear factor can simultaneously (i) generate cross-correlations in output, labor, consumption, and investment consistent with the postwar US economy; and (ii) generates variation in equity prices, bond prices, and a large risk premium in line with the asset pricing data. Six novel insights emerge from the model: (1) actively regulating the safe interest rate (in both directions) can mitigate the fluctuations generated by fear cycles; (2) recessions will be deeper and longer when central banks accept the zero lower bound and are unwilling to use negative rates; (3) a commitment to use negative rates in recessions\u2014even if never implemented\u2014raises both the short- and long-run real neutral rates, and moderates the business cycle; (4) counter-cyclical fiscal policy can act as disaster insurance and be expansionary by reducing fear; (5) quantitative easing can be narrowly effective only when fear is high at the lower bound; and (6) when fear is high, especially at the lower bound, policies that boost productivity also help fight recessions.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/09/09/The-Fear-Economy-A-Theory-of-Output-Interest-and-Safe-Assets-523265","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"9 September 2022"},{"id":368,"date":"September 9, 2022","day":9,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Climate Change and Energy Security: The Dilemma or Opportunity of the Century?","authors":"Serhan Cevik","abstract":"This paper investigates the connection between climate change and energy security in Europe and provides empirical evidence that these issues are the two faces of the same coin.

Both countries of EA-BDF share a common endogenous monetary policy and, thanks to our multi-country setup, we can deal with both symmetric and asymmetric shocks. Our illustrations about the effects of a government spending shock in a monetary union deliver two key results, which are robust whatever the type of expectations. First, by studying symmetric and asymmetric shocks on government spending, kept constant for 2 years, we find that, at this 2-year horizon, trade spillovers would compensate monetary policy spillovers within the euro area. Second, we also find, in the case of a symmetric shock, that the government spending multiplier is smaller under a monetary policy rule based on price-level targeting than on inflation targeting.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/ea-bdf-model-and-government-spending-multipliers-monetary-union","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 September 2022"},{"id":375,"date":"September 7, 2022","day":7,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"What Matters for Job Finding and Separation in the Long Run?

Studies on the measurement of fire sale vulnerabilities in part those associated with NBFIs in a financial system are often conducted at the jurisdiction level using fire-sale (FS) models. While existing studies use granular data to analyze details of fire sale dynamics; in most of these cases, the scope of analysis is focused on a certain jurisdiction or asset class, leaving the cross-jurisdiction or cross-asset spillover dimension out of the scope. To address these points, this paper measures cross-border and cross-asset spillovers of market shocks (\\"interlinkage effect\\") in the GFS using a standard FS model, specifically focusing on the role of NBFIs. With the help of existing FS models, we construct measures of the interlinkage effect across different types of financial institutions, including banks and various types of NBFIs, in Japan\'s financial system as well as those for the foreign financial system (the U.S. and Euro area) using flow of funds data of these jurisdictions. We find that the interlinkage effect has increased substantially, not only for Japan\'s financial system, but also for the overseas financial system since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). These increasing interlinkages of NBFIs with various types of entities suggest there has been a global structural change in the transmission of market shocks.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e14.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"5 September 2022"},{"id":377,"date":"September 2, 2022","day":2,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Quarterly Projection Model for the Bank of Ghana","authors":"Philip Abradu-Otoo, Ivy Acquaye, Abubakar Addy, Nana Kwame Akosah, James Attuquaye, Simon Harvey, Shalva Mkhatrishvili, Zakari Mumuni, Valeriu Nalban","abstract":"The paper describes the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) that underlies the Bank of Ghana Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS).

My main finding is that expected, rather than current, GDP growth shapes the dynamics of firm entry. Specifically, I find that entry increases with past exits at the sector-level, but only when aggregate GDP growth is forecasted to be strong. Also, with strong growth forecasts, past entry developments weight less on the subsequent sectoral entry dynamics. Periods of low entry and high exit, can therefore be followed by strong entry subsequently, when the economy is expected to grow strongly. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several controls. This includes the quality of insolvency proceedings, firms\' ability to obtain credit or the presence of barriers to entry.

Inflation is less responsive to monetary policy due to the interaction with productivity dynamics.

To answer this question we study the impact of the publication of the EU-wide stress tests in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021 on the first (\u03bb) and second (\u03b4) moment of equity returns. First, we study the effect of the disclosure of stress tests on (cumulative) excess/abnormal returns through a one-factor market model. Second, we study whether both returns and volatility of bank stock prices changes upon the disclosure of stress tests through a structural GARCH model, developed by Engle and Siriwardane (2018). Our results suggest that the publication of stress tests provides new information to markets. Banks performing poorly in stress tests experience, on average, a reduction in returns and an increase in volatility, while the reverse holds true for banks performing well. Banks performing moderately have rather a small effect on both mean and variance process. Our findings are corroborated by the observed rank correlation between bank abnormal returns or equity volatility and stress test performance, which experiences a steady increase after each publication event.

The financial markets are highly integrated, and valuations of financial assets follow international patterns, which has contributed to large increases in financial wealth over the past 25 years. Nonetheless, this has not led to an equally large increase in property income because the rates of return have decreased during the same era. Moreover, changes in functional income distribution (capital/labour shares) have not been fully transmitted to the distribution of primary income between households because other institutional sectors \u2013 particularly the government sector \u2013 hold considerable amounts of financial assets. At least in the short term, the decrease in rates of return seems to contradict claims that, due to an increase in both financial and inherited wealth, we are entering an era of increasing income inequality. In this article, the link between financial wealth and pre-tax household income distribution is scrutinised for three European countries using a conceptually fully consistent macro framework. First, national balance sheets are combined with the related income flows. After this, income flows that are not property income but are considered part of national income (e.g., wages and salaries) are added, the national income flows are broken down by institutional sector and the household sector income flows separated. Finally, distributional household micro data are used to break down the aggregate household sector income flows by income decile. The article utilises this framework to analyse the evolution of rates of return and capital and labour shares as well as how the property income flows created by financial wealth have affected household primary income distribution.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2707~94a29f204d.en.pdf?4172cc058c4f858bb5dd3eb93a77c126","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"11 August 2022"},{"id":403,"date":"11 August 2022","day":11,"month":8,"year":2022,"title":"Monetary policy transmission in segmented markets","authors":"Jens Eisenschmidt, Yiming Ma, Anthony Lee Zhang","abstract":"We show that dealer market power impedes the pass-through of monetary policy in repo markets, which is an important first stage of monetary policy transmission.

The source of preferred habitat demand is an insurance fund that issues annuities and adopts a liability-driven strategy to minimise the duration risk on its balance sheet. The optimising behaviour of the insurance fund implies a preferred-habitat demand function that is upward-sloping in bond prices and downward-sloping in bond yields, especially when interest rates are low. This supports the operation of a recruitment channel at low interest rates, whereby long-term interest rates react strongly to short-term policy rates because of complementary changes in term premia induced by preferred-habitat demand.

We apply a local projection method to a new dataset of debt surges in 190 countries between 1970 and 2020. Our results show that the relationship between debt surges and economic growth are complex. Debt surges tend to be followed by weaker economic growth and persistently lower output. However, this negative relationship does not always hold. Surges in public debt tend to have the most negative impact on future growth prospects. This is particularly the case if the economy is already operating with a large positive output gap. Debt surges also tend to be followed by weaker economic growth if the initial debt levels are high, especially for private debt surges. Our results also show how debt surges impact future growth. Public debt surges are associated with especially weaker private and public investment, although both private and public consumption are also negatively affected.

Prevalent legal constraints on the basis of gender prevent women, and thereby economies, from reaching their true potential. In this regard, this paper (i) documents the evolution of gender discriminatory laws around the globe, and (ii) sheds light on the role of legal gender equality in income convergence across countries. It shows that despite the remarkable progress toward gender equality in the law over the last five decades, the legal environment across the world is still far from providing a level playing field for women. Moreover, cross-country gaps in gender discriminatory laws have persisted and even widened over the years, meaning that some countries have lagged behind the progress in repealing the laws that act as a barrier to women\u2019s economic inclusion. Based on a global sample since the 1970s, this paper finds that greater gender equality in the law facilitates cross-country income convergence over time. The results call for action and provide a reason to be optimistic going forward. They imply that legal reforms supportive of gender equality, which could indeed be actionable in the shorter term, help poorer countries catch up with the living standards in the advanced economies.

We nowcast the Consumption Activity Index (CAI), which is compiled and released by the Bank of Japan, using the ALC. With respect to timeliness, the ALC has a significant advantage over the CAI; the ALC for the month is available in the middle of the following month, approximately 3 weeks earlier than the release of the CAI. Our findings show that the ALC is generally accurate in nowcasting the CAI and thus aggregate consumption developments. It also accurately captures the substantial changes in consumption activities caused by the spread of COVID-19 since spring 2020. Overall, the results suggest that alternative data can capture macro level consumption activity promptly and accurately, making them a powerful tool for understanding economic conditions.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e08.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 July 2022"},{"id":444,"date":"July 28, 2022","day":28,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Constructing GDP Nowcasting Models Using Alternative Data","authors":"Takashi Nakaza","abstract":"With coronavirus (COVID-19) having a significant impact on economic activity, the existing GDP nowcasting model, using only monthly and quarterly economic data, has become difficult to forecast with high accuracy.

The estimates are conducted through two approaches, the hedonic approach and local projection, for the sampled sites that are selected from the viewpoint of avoiding potential omitted variable bias. Our main findings are threefold: (a) hazard map information affects land prices in a statistically significant manner. The effect is accompanied by a lag and its size varies depending on land use. (b) In addition to hazard map information, past flooding experiences affect land prices, suggesting the importance of the role played by the subjective flood risk perception formed through past flooding experiences. Indeed, in areas where large-scale flooding has occurred frequently in the past, hazard map information is reflected in the level of land prices to a greater degree and land prices are less susceptible to changes in hazard map information. (c) The estimated impact of flood risk on land prices based on the two approaches does not deviate significantly from the alternative measure of the impact of flood risk on land prices computed using the actual flood damage. However, the differences between the estimated impact and the alternative measure may become large for a certain type of flood risk and land use. Our results suggest that, in addition to the objective flood risk contained in, for example, hazard map, subjective perceptions of flood risk, such as those reflected in past flooding experiences, may also be important in land price formation.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e12.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 July 2022"},{"id":448,"date":"July 28, 2022","day":28,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Housing Boom and Headline Inflation: Insights from Machine Learning","authors":"Yang Liu, Di Yang, Yunhui Zhao","abstract":"Inflation has been rising during the pandemic against supply chain disruptions and a multi-year boom in global owner-occupied house prices.

Alternative sources could replace up to 70 percent of Russian gas, allowing Europe to avoid shortages during a temporary disruption of around 6 months. However, a longer full shut-off of Russian gas to the whole of Europe would likely interact with infrastructure bottlenecks to produce very high prices and significant shortages in some countries, with parts of Central and Eastern Europe most vulnerable. With natural gas an important input in production, the capacity of the economy would shrink. Our findings suggest that in the short term, the most vulnerable countries in Central and Eastern Europe \u2014 Hungary, Slovak Republic and Czechia \u2014 face a risk of shortages of as much as 40 percent of gas consumption and of gross domestic product shrinking by up to 6 percent.

We find that such a scenario could lead to gas shortages of 9 percent of national consumption in the second half of 2022, 10 percent in 2023 and 4 percent in 2024, which would be worse in the winter months, and would likely fall on firms, given legal protections on households. We combine the effects of less gas on production with the consequent effects of reduced supply of intermediate goods and services to downstream firms, and with reduced economic activity due to rising uncertainty. Together, these three channels reduce German GDP relative to baseline levels by about 1.5 percent in 2022, 2.7 percent in 2023 and 0.4 percent in 2024, with no gains in subsequent years from deferred economic activity. The associated rise in wholesale gas prices could increase inflation by about 2 percentage points on average in 2022 and 2023. Our simulations suggest that the economic impacts can be reduced significantly by having households voluntarily share a small part of the burden, and by rationing gas supplies more to more gas-intensive and downstream firms. We also suggest other ways to enhance German energy security.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/18/The-Economic-Impacts-on-Germany-of-a-Potential-Russian-Gas-Shutoff-520931","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 July 2022"},{"id":467,"date":"18 July 2022","day":18,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Capital flows and monetary policy trade-offs in emerging market economies","authors":"Paolo Cavallino, Boris Hofmann","abstract":"We lay out a small open economy model incorporating key features of EME economic and financial structure: high exchange rate pass-through to import prices, low pass-through to export prices and shallow domestic financial markets giving rise to occasionally binding leverage constraints. As a consequence of the latter, a sudden stop with large capital outflows can give rise to a financial crisis. In the sudden stop, the central bank faces an intratemporal trade-off as output declines while inflation rises. In normal times, there is an intertemporal trade-off as the risk of a future sudden stop forces the central bank to factor financial stability considerations into its policy conduct. The optimal monetary policy leans against capital flows and domestic leverage. Macroprudential, capital flow management and central bank balance sheet policies can help to mitigate both intra- and intertemporal trade-offs. Fiscal policy also plays a key role. A higher level of public debt and a weaker fiscal policy imply greater leverage and hence greater tail risk for the economy.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1032.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 July 2022"},{"id":468,"date":"18 July 2022","day":18,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"The Holt-Winters filter and the one-sided HP filter: A close correspondence","authors":"Rodrigo Alfaro, Mathias Drehmann","abstract":"We show that the trend of the one-sided HP filter can be asymptotically approx-imated by the Holt-Winters (HW) filter.

Alternative approaches such as average inflation targeting (AIT), price-level targeting (PLT) and nominal GDP-level targeting (NGDP) have gained attention in academic and policy discussions. These history-dependent regimes can be powerful and effective in stabilizing an economy because the central bank has to make up for past misses. However, their performance depends on forward-looking expectations and people\u2019s understanding of how these regimes work. Despite the recent attention these alternative approaches to monetary policy have received, evidence of the public\u2019s understanding remains limited.\\nUsing a unified experimental framework, we provide a comprehensive assessment of five monetary policy regimes: inflation targeting (IT), dual mandate (DM), AIT, PLT and NGDP. We study how effectively people can understand and form macroeconomic expectations under the different policy frameworks, both throughout periods of economic stability away from the effective lower bound (ELB) and during demand-driven recessions at the ELB. We take the simple New Keynesian model used in the Bank of Canada\'s own theoretical analysis to the laboratory and run an experimental horse race of the five alternatives.\\nOur results suggest a distinct ranking of the monetary policy regimes in terms of their ability to achieve macroeconomic stability. Rate-targeting approaches such as IT, DM and AIT significantly outperform level-targeting regimes such as PLT and NGDP in minimizing deviations of inflation, the output gap and nominal interest rates from target. IT, DM, and AIT with a short four-quarter horizon deliver similar performances. AIT with a shorter horizon (4 quarters) performs better than with a longer horizon (10 quarters). Monetary policy regimes that are framed around the inflation rate (e.g., AIT with a 10-quarter horizon) are found to deliver significantly more stable economic outcomes than those that target price levels (PLT).","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/7/staff-working-paper-2022-33","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 July 2022"},{"id":471,"date":"07/15/2022","day":15,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"From Macro to Micro: Large Exporters Coping with Common Shocks","authors":"By Bricongne Jean-Charles, Carluccio Juan, Fontagn\xe9 Lionel, Gaulier Guillaume, Stumpner Sebastian","abstract":"Since Gabaix (2011), the role of changes in the performance of some very large firms in shaping aggregate outcomes has been intensively studied in the economic literature. Changes in the performance of a few large firms can arise due to idiosyncratic shocks or idiosyncratic reactions to common shocks. This paper provides direct evidence for the second channel using data on the universe of French firm-level exports and imports over 1993-2020. Granularity matters for the micro-dynamics of aggregate French exports over the long run: the granular residual explains 42% of the variance in aggregate export growth during the period. Moreover, it co-moves with the macro shocks: the largest firms do better than average in good times and worse in bad times. Studying firm-level performance during the Great Financial Crisis and the Pandemic reveals that top exporters contributed to the export collapses disproportionably more than their pre-crisis share of exports, even within finely defined markets. We investigate the reasons for such over-reaction of the top exporters using the Pandemic as a natural experiment. We find that a higher elasticity to demand shocks explains the larger reaction of top exporters to the Pandemic, with GVC exposure having weak explanatory power. Our findings have macro implications, as they help understand the macro reaction to foreign shocks, and micro implications, since they can inform micro models of exports.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/macro-micro-large-exporters-coping-common-shocks","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 July 2022"},{"id":472,"date":"July 15, 2022","day":15,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"A Comprehensive Package of Macroeconomic Policy Measures for Implementing China\u2019s Climate Mitigation Strategy","authors":"Jean Chateau, Wenjie Chen, Florence Jaumotte, Karlygash Zhunussova","abstract":"This paper presents ways for China to achieve its climate goals while also attain high-quality growth\u2014growth that is balanced, inclusive, and green.

By leveraging 1,058 changes in the local business tax rate between 2013 and 2017, we find that a one percentage point tax increase results in a 0.4% increase in the retail prices of goods produced by taxed _rms and purchased by consumers in the rest of Germany, who thus end up bearing a substantial share of the tax burden.

Using data on domestic market prices of the five most consumed staple foods from 15 countries, this paper finds that external factors drive food price inflation, but domestic factors can mitigate these vulnerabilities. On the external side, our estimations show that Sub-Saharan African countries are highly vulnerable to global food prices, with the pass-through from global to local food prices estimated close to unity for highly imported staples. On the domestic side, staple food price inflation is lower in countries with greater local production and among products with lower consumption shares. Additionally, adverse shocks such as natural disasters and wars bring 1.8 and 4 percent staple food price surges respectively beyond generalized price increases. Economic policy can lower food price inflation, as the strength of monetary policy and fiscal frameworks, the overall economic environment, and transport constraints in geographically challenged areas account for substantial cross-country differences in staple food prices.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Staple-Food-Prices-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa-An-Empirical-Assessment-520567","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"8 July 2022"},{"id":489,"date":"July 8, 2022","day":8,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Contagion as a Dealmaker?

For the first time, European mechanisms were called to design financing programmes for member countries in trouble. This paper analyses how the risk of contagion, an essential characteristic of interlinked economies, shapes borrowing conditions. We focus on the role of spillovers as a channel of bargaining power that a country might have when asking for financial support from regional lending institutions. We build and present a new database that records both the dates on which official meetings took place, relevant statements were released and the timing of the announcements regarding loan disbursements. This database allows us to assess the defining role that announcements of future actions have in mitigating spillover costs. In addition, we study the design of lending arrangements within a recursive contract between a lender and a sovereign country. When accounting for spillover costs, arising from the borrower to the creditor, we find that it is in the lender\'s best interest to back-load consumption by giving more weight to future transfers in order to reduce contagion cost. Subsequently, we test and validate our theoretical predictions by assessing the effect of spillovers on loan disbursements to programme-countries and by juxtaposing lending conditions imposed by the IMF and the European mechanisms.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Contagion-as-a-Dealmaker-The-Effect-of-Financial-Spillovers-on-Regional-Lending-Programs-515165","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"8 July 2022"},{"id":490,"date":"July 8, 2022","day":8,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Financial Development and Growth in the Caucasus and Central Asia","authors":"Tigran Poghosyan","abstract":"This paper presents stylized facts on financial development in the CCA countries relative to their EM and LIC peers and assesses how financial development can boost growth in the CCA.

Under fiscal dominance, higher deficits also increase the dispersion of possible future inflationary outcomes, especially the probability of high inflation. Based on forecasts from our model, the high inflation experienced by many countries during the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic appears more consistent with a regime of fiscal dominance than monetary dominance.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1028.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 July 2022"},{"id":495,"date":"07 juli 2022","day":7,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Banks\u2019 Seasoned Equity Offerings Announcements and Central Bank Lending Operations","authors":"Massimo Giuliodori, Jan Kakes, Dimitris Mokas","abstract":"","linkarticle":"https://www.dnb.nl/publicaties/publicaties-onderzoek/working-paper-2022/748-banks-seasoned-equity-offerings-announcements-and-central-bank-lending-operations/","centralbank":"De Nederlandsche Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 July 2022"},{"id":496,"date":"06 July 2022","day":6,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"What drives repo haircuts?

We compare MC and QMC for typical economics problems and introduce economists to quantum computation. Our paper focuses on two such problems: (a) stress testing banks subject to credit shocks and fire sales and (b) solving a neoclassical dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with deep learning. In stress testing, we use QMC to estimate the expected system-wide capital loss of the banking system after a few periods of financial stress. In the deep learning solution of the neoclassical macroeconomic model, QMC estimates how a large economy behaves in the presence of random productivity shocks.\\nOur paper is written such that an economist without any knowledge of quantum computation can gradually progress to fully implementing the QMC algorithm for their problem of interest.

In recent years, different interpretability techniques have appeared to assist in this task, although their usefulness is still a matter of debate. In this article we contribute to the debate by creating a framework to assess the accuracy of these interpretability techniques. We start from the generation of synthetic data sets, following an approach that allows us to control the importance of each explanatory variable (feature) in our target variable. By defining the importance of features ourselves, we can then calculate to what extent the explanations given by the interpretability techniques match the underlying truth. Therefore, if in our synthetic dataset we define a feature as relevant to the target variable, the interpretability technique should also identify it as a relevant feature. We run an empirical example in which we generate synthetic datasets intended to resemble underwriting and credit rating datasets, where the target variable is a binary variable representing applicant default. We then use non-interpretable ML models, such as deep learning, to predict default, and then explain their results using two popular interpretability techniques, SHAP and permutation Feature Importance (FI). Our results using the proposed framework suggest that SHAP is better at interpreting relevant features as such, although the results may vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the ML model used. We conclude that generating synthetic datasets shows potential as a useful approach for supervisors and practitioners looking for solutions to assess the interpretability tools available for ML models in the financial sector.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2222e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 June 2022"},{"id":526,"date":"22/06/2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"A quantification of the evolution of bilateral trade flows once bilateral RTAs are implemented","authors":"Blanca Jim\xe9nez-Garc\xeda and Julio Rodr\xedguez","abstract":"In this paper we study how 103 bilateral Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) shape bilateral trade flows over time. The analysis of quarterly trade flows from 1982 Q4 to 2018 Q4 shows dynamic differences between RTAs and among trading partners. Results show that countries benefit unevenly from bilateral RTAs. The positive global trade trend since the 1990s and the negative effect of the 2008 economic crisis are captured by a factor analysis that allows us to study specifically how trade agreements affect bilateral trade asymmetrically. On average, RTAs lead to a 10% increase in bilateral trade flows above the mean trend, but disparities are found since Partial Scope Agreements (PSAs) tend to boost bilateral trade more than Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) (21% compared to 9%). However, most of the effects of PSAs occur during the first four quarters after the agreements come into force, whereas FTAs have effects over a longer period. The current study uses cluster analysis to classify bilateral trade flows into homogeneous groups according to the dynamic impact that RTAs have on them. This allows the heterogeneity between clusters to be explored. Moreover, the results show a difference relating to the economic crisis starting in 2008: in general, the impact on bilateral trade of agreements in force before 2008 is positive (30%), while it is negative for agreements signed after 2008 (-9%). This indicates that RTAs play a heterogeneous role as a cycle smoothing mechanism. Finally, there is evidence of an anticipation effect: we find that for more than half of the bilateral trade flows studied, the effect of the bilateral RTA is detected before it comes into force.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2220e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"22 June 2022"},{"id":527,"date":"22 June 2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"The effects of local demand and supply restrictions on markup","authors":"Antonio Acconcia and Elisa Scarinzi","abstract":"We investigate the causal response of markup to a contraction in local demand and supply by comparing the response to these shocks across sectors characterized by different degrees of local competition.

A distressed firm exhibits both cash-flow and balance-sheet insolvency whereas a zombie firm is a distressed company that has received new credit. We carry out several analyses to test the validity of these definitions. For instance, we find that being distressed is negatively correlated with the probability of receiving new credit. However, the main bank of a distressed firm is more reluctant to restrict the supply of credit to such firm than a bank with no previous exposure to the company, which may reflect the incentives of the former to engage in loan evergreening. This financial support contributes to keeping zombie firms afloat for a longer period than distressed firms. Moreover, the contraction in capital, employment and sales is much larger in distressed firms than in zombie firms.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2219e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 June 2022"},{"id":535,"date":"17 June 2022","day":17,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"New facts on consumer price rigidity in the euro area","authors":"Erwan Gautier, Cristina Conflitti, Riemer P.

The result of the analysis is twofold. First, flood shocks dampen GDP from the supply side by reducing the capital stock inputs. The decline in GDP then impairs the balance sheets of firms and financial intermediaries, resulting in disruptions to financial intermediation and thus dampening GDP further from the demand side. Even when the direct damage due to floods is fully covered by insurance, the downward pressure on GDP endogenously deteriorates the balance sheets of these sectors, causing the same mechanism to operate. Second, the quantitative impacts of flood shocks on GDP up to now have been minor compared to the standard structural shocks that are considered important in existing macroeconomic studies, including shocks to total factor productivity (TFP) and the subjective discount factor. According to the estimates that use the relationship between the key variables in our model together with climate change scenarios published by an external organization, the impacts of these shocks could become somewhat larger in the future.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e05.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 June 2022"},{"id":556,"date":"June 3, 2022","day":3,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"How Do Floods Affect the Economy?

Natural disasters primarily damage the assets owned by firms and households and public infrastructure, i.e., direct effects, but they may also affect the economic activity through the subsequent changes in production inputs, i.e., indirect effects. While there is already a large number of empirical analysis on the indirect effects, however, no consensus has been established not only on the scale and persistence, but even on the signs. In this paper, we estimate the indirect effects of past flood disasters in Japan on the real economy using Prefectural Accounts and Flood Statistics. There are three main findings. First, while floods have a negative effect on the GDP of the prefecture in which they occur, this effect may not persist over the long run as it loses statistical significance after the year following the year of occurrence. Second, floods have different effects across sectors. Floods generally have a negative effect on GDP of the manufacturing and the wholesale and retail sectors, while they tend to have a positive effect on GDP of the construction sector. Third, the magnitude of the indirect effect of floods differs for asset, facility, and equipment that incurs damage. Compared to damage to the assets owned by firms and households, damage to public infrastructure, such as roads, and to public service utilities, such as electric power facilities, tend to depress GDP more significantly, which may indicate the importance of public assets in the spillover effects of flood damage.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e06.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 June 2022"},{"id":557,"date":"June 3, 2022","day":3,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"Fintech, Female Employment, and Gender Inequality","authors":"Boileau Loko, Yuanchen Yang","abstract":"Fintech, which delivers financial services digitally, promises to promote financial inclusion and close the gender gap.

In the model, a central banker (CB) wants to influence the private sector beliefs, which are heterogeneous, to generate an upward bias in their action. The CB can engender such welfare-improving bias by providing public information, choosing a signalling strategy that is a function of fundamentals. To study this optimal communication strategy, I introduce heterogeneous priors in an otherwise standard Bayesian persuasion model \xe0 la Gentzkow and Kamenica (2011) and characterize the dependence of optimal disclosure on the heterogeneity of beliefs. I show that heterogeneity matters in two ways: (i) it is optimal to send moderating signals, which implies sending signals with positive error probabilities in both states, and constitutes a non-trivial departure from the homogeneous beliefs case; (ii) higher dispersion in beliefs leads the monetary authority to send signals with lower error probabilities. I apply my framework to a central bank communication problem in which the policy maker communicates about aggregate conditions to influence firms\' investment decisions in presence of investment externalities. I empirically validate the model\'s predictions by showing that the FOMC unemployment rate forecasts are systematically biased in opposite directions in recessions and expansions. Also in line with the model\'s predictions, the forecast biases are decreasing in the degree of private sector disagreement for each state.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/state-dependent-central-bank-communication-heterogeneous-beliefs","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 June 2022"},{"id":566,"date":"1 June 2022","day":1,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"Temporal networks in the analysis of financial contagion","authors":"Fabio Franch, Luca Nocciola, Angelos Vouldis","abstract":"This paper studies the dynamics of contagion across the banking, insurance and shadow banking sectors of 16 advanced economies in the period 2006-2018.

This paper asks how the burden of childcare affects the labor market integration of immigrants. To identify the contribution of this burden to the native-immigrant employment gap, it exploits European Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) microdata from 2004 to 2019. This survey collects information on respondents\u2019 counterfactual behaviour, in the event that: a) they had no care responsibilities; b) they could find a job compatible with their care responsibilities; c) they had access to childcare services. This information allows estimates to be obtained of the impact of childcare on labor supply comparable across eleven countries. Our results show that the burden of childcare is the major obstacle to the integration of immigrant mothers. While the employment gap between non-EU immigrant and native mothers in Northern and Southern Europe is 35 and 17 percentage points (pp) respectively, two-thirds (24 pp and 12 pp) of it is explained by childcare motivated inactivity. We reject the hypothesis that the childcare gap is solely driven by immigrants\u2019 sociodemographic traits or traditional parenting norms. Our estimates suggest that at least a quarter (5.8 pp and 2.6 pp) of the gap is due to the higher opportunity cost of paid work faced by immigrant mothers; that equal access to childcare could reduce it by 10 pp and 7 pp; and that immigrants\u2019 exclusion from flexible time arrangements could explain the larger size and higher persistence of the gap in the North. This paper contributes to the literature on immigrant integration, highlighting that the child penalty is the main obstacle to female migrant labor supply and that differences in how European societies handle the burden of care can account for their records on the integration of immigrant households, suggesting that family policies could be central to the integration policy mix and even influence the migration decision.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2216e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"31 May 2022"},{"id":570,"date":"31 May 2022","day":31,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"One scheme fits all: a central fiscal capacity for the EMU targeting eurozone, national and regional shocks","authors":"Roel Beetsma, Jacopo Cimadomo, Josha van Spronsen","abstract":"This paper proposes a central fiscal capacity for the euro area that generates transfers in response to eurozone, country, and region-specific shocks.

Workhorse monetary models, which are much forward-looking, find them so effective that they run into the forward-guidance puzzle. Models that discount the future further find them much less effective, but imply that agents discount the very perception of future policy rates. This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We build on one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle (Woodford\u2019s finite planning horizons) by amending the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting. Second, we find that make-up strategies that always respond to past economic conditions, such as average inflation targeting, do too but that their stabilization benefits over IT can be reduced by the existence of the ELB.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2218e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"30 May 2022"},{"id":572,"date":"May 27, 2022","day":27,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The Current Account Income Balance: External Adjustment Channel or Vulnerability Amplifier?","authors":"Alberto Behar, Ramin Hassan","abstract":"In terms of size, the net income balance (IB) is comparable to the trade balance (TB) for many countries.

We design a data-intensive local version of the Lerner index by developing heuristics to allocate national-level banks\' inputs, products, and costs across their branches using large-scale datasets from many sources. We then exploit the exogenous variation in COVID-19 intensity across Brazilian localities to analyze how the pandemic influenced local market power through the effective price and marginal cost channels. Despite reducing the economic activity, COVID-19 did not impact the effective price channel: bank branches offset the decrease in credit income by reducing credit concessions. However, bank branches more affected by COVID-19 experienced increased marginal costs as they could not rapidly adjust their cost factors in response to the decrease in credit concessions. Consequently, COVID-19 reduced banks\' local market power via the marginal cost channel. More digitalized bank branches enjoy cost and lending flexibility: they experience less stickiness in their cost structure and complement the reduced credit concessions in localities more affected by COVID-19 by extending credit to borrowers in remote localities less affected. Consequently, more digitalized banks improve their market power compared to traditional banks. This paper provides new insights into how crises can affect local market power in non-trivial ways.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1017.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":581,"date":"25 May 2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The limited power of monetary policy in a pandemic","authors":"Antoine Lepetit, Cristina Fuentes-Albero","abstract":"We embed an extension of the canonical epidemiology model in a New Keynesian model and analyze the role of monetary policy as a virus spreads and triggers a sizable recession. In our framework, consumption is less sensitive to real interest changes in a pandemic than in normal times because individuals have to balance the benefits of taking advantage of intertemporal substitution opportunities with the risk of becoming sick. Accommodative monetary policies such as forward guidance result in large increases in inflation but have only limited effects on real economic activity as long as the risk of infection is large. The optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is conducted optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target. However, if the lockdown policy is not optimal, the central bank faces a trade-off between its objective of stabilizing inflation and the necessity to minimize the inefficiencies associated with virus spread.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1018.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":582,"date":"25 May 2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Unconventional credit policy in an economy under zero lower bound","authors":"Jorge Pozo, Youel Rojas","abstract":"In this paper we develop a simple two-period model that reconciles credit demand and supply frictions. In this stylized but realistic model credit and deposit markets are interlinked and credit demand and credit supply frictions amplify each other in such a way that produces in equilibrium inefficiently low levels of credit and stronger reductions of the real and nominal interest rates, so an economy is much closer to the ZLB. However, an unconventional credit policy, that consists on central bank liquidity injection to banks provided they commit to issue loans (indirect central bank loans) that are guaranteed by the government, can undo partially the effects of the credit frictions and prevents the economy from reaching the ZLB. Since indirect central bank (CB) loans cannot be diverted by banks and are governmentguaranteed, credit market interventions rise aggregate credit supply and positively affect the aggregate credit demand, respectively. However, once the economy is at the ZLB the effect of a credit policy is reduced due to a relatively stronger inflation reduction, which in turn reduces entrepreneurs\' incentives to demand bank loans, and due to that the relative cost reduction from having access to cheaper indirect CB loans is smaller.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1019.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":583,"date":"05/25/2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Natural Disasters and Financial Stress: Can Macroprudential Regulation Tame Green Swans?

Faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-border payment services will deliver widespread benefits for citizens and economies worldwide, supporting economic growth, international trade, global development, and financial inclusion. Enhancing cross-border payments requires more than mere adoption of technical standards. The best outcome involves aligned technological, regulatory, and legal frameworks. This paper analyzes such payment integration projects.\\nEach border adds to the costs of a cross-border payment if crossing the border means entering into a different technological, regulatory and legal environment, with different systems, regulators, and courts. Under ideal circumstances, cross-border payments will be processed as seamlessly as comparable domestic payments, even where various currencies are processed. While this highly ambitious target is unlikely to be achieved globally in the short to medium term, regionally, the gap between cross-border and domestic payments has already been narrowed. At the global level, mismatches between the inter-institutional framework on the back-end and the contractual relationship with clients on the front-end represent potential costs for the payment services provider and increase legal risk, prompting costly legal, due diligence manual adjustments in payments processes. A high degree of cross-border harmonization via rulebooks along the technological, regulatory, and legal dimensions has been instrumental for successful regional integration projects and has promoted straight-through-processing. Potentially costly events such as rejects, returns, and revocations of payment orders have been reduced, sanction screening and financial crime compliance processes agreed.\\nDrawing on this insight, this paper suggests globally coordinated action to develop a comprehensive framework to guide and support regional payment integration.

This approach can therefore offer a broad picture of the disaggregated effects of financial stability policies. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, including data from a leading UK real estate online search engine as well as loan-level regulatory data. With a series of comparative statics exercises, we investigate the impact of: i) a hard loan-to-value limit, and ii) a soft loan-to-income limit, allowing for a limited share of unconstrained new mortgages. We find that, first, these experiments tend to mitigate the house price cycle by reducing credit availability and therefore leverage. Second, an experiment targeting a specific risk measure may also affect other risk metrics, thus necessitating a careful calibration of the policy to achieve a given reduction in risk. Third, experiments targeting the owner-occupier housing market can spill over to the rental sector, as a compositional shift in home ownership from owner-occupiers to buy-to-let investors affects both the supply of and demand for rental properties.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2217e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 May 2022"},{"id":602,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"DISPERSION OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE: PASSTHROUGH, PRODUCTIVITY, AND DEMAND","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-414-dispersion-over-the-business-cycle-passthrough-productivity-and-demand.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":603,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Trading volume and liquidity provision in cryptocurreny markets","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-413-trading-volume-and-liquidity-provision-in-cryptocurreny-markets.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":604,"date":"2022-05-16","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Transmission of Cyber Risk Through the Canadian Wholesale Payment System","authors":"Kosse, Anneke, Lu, Zhentong","abstract":"In response to growing concerns about cyber and other operational risks\u2014such as those related to climate change\u2014international organizations, central banks and private sector entities have taken collaborative actions to increase the operational and data resilience of financial institutions and financial market infrastructures, including payment systems. In Canada, the Bank of Canada has established and leads the Canadian Financial Sector Resiliency Group and the Resilience of Wholesale Payments Systems (RWPS) initiative, which both offer a forum for coordinating a national sectoral response to systemic operational incidents, such as cyber attacks (see Dinis 2021 for details).\xa0\\nAs part of the RWPS initiative, this paper studies how the impact of a cyber attack that paralyzes one or multiple banks\' ability to send payments would transmit to other banks through the Canadian wholesale payment system.

We find that depending on the type and number of banks under attack, the time of the attack and the design of the payment system, a cyber attack can quickly become systemic and result in a significant loss of liquidity throughout the system. We also demonstrate that the system-wide impact of an attack can be significantly reduced by having contingency plans that enable attacked banks to continue to send high-value payments. Given the interconnectedness of banks, we conclude that the cyber resilience of a wholesale payment system depends strongly on the cyber resilience of its participants, and we underline the importance of strong sectoral collaboration and coordination.\xa0","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/5/staff-working-paper-2022-23","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":605,"date":"13 May 2022","day":13,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The digital economy, privacy, and CBDC","authors":"Toni Ahnert, Peter Hoffmann, Cyril Monnet","abstract":"We study a model of financial intermediation, payment choice, and privacy in the digital economy.

To address this question, the impact of weather shocks on real per capita GDP growth is quantified under the two alternative exchange rate regimes. We find that although weather shocks are generally detrimental to per capita income growth, the impact is less severe under flexible exchange rate regimes. Moreover, the medium-term adverse growth impact of a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature under a pegged regime is about \u20131.4 percentage points on average, while under a flexible regime, the impact is less than one half that amount (\u20130.6 percentage point). This finding bolsters the idea that exchange rate flexibility not only helps mitigate the initial impact of the shock but also promotes a faster recovery. In terms of mechanisms, our findings suggest that the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate under a flexible regime supports real export growth. In contrast to standard theoretical predictions, we find that countercyclical fiscal policy may not be effective under pegged regimes amid high debt, highlighting the importance of the policy mix and precautionary (fiscal) buffers.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/05/13/Weather-Shocks-and-Exchange-Rate-Flexibility-517525","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 May 2022"},{"id":612,"date":"2022-05-12","day":12,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Nonparametric Identification of Incomplete Information Discrete Games with Non-equilibrium Behaviors","authors":"Xie, Erhao","abstract":"In the literature that estimates discrete games with incomplete information, researchers usually impose two assumptions.

We call this finding asymmetric systemic risk and explore the consequences and channels behind it.\\nWe hypothesize that banks with different business models undertake activities that affect their contributions and exposures to the system differently. These differences create asymmetric (directional) linkages with the rest of the banking system that matter for individual bank stability. We capture this directionality by consistently comparing the flows of risk in the bank-to-system and system-to-bank direction. We find that banks with a stronger system-to-bank connection had a higher default risk during the global financial crisis (2008\u201309), and that the mechanism behind increased default risk runs through trading and asset risk, increasing the volatility of profits.\\nOur findings offer two important policy implications. Firstly, linkages in the financial system can be directional, and regulation should concentrate on imposing buffers on banks with positive net exposures, rather than just on large banks. Secondly, current bank supervision objectives can be achieved more efficiently if regulation focuses on preventing such net exposures, rather than buffering the default risks arising from them.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/5/staff-working-paper-2022-19","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 May 2022"},{"id":638,"date":"02 mei 2022","day":2,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Central Bank Communication with the General Public: Promise or False Hope?","authors":"Alan Blinder, Michael Ehrmann, Jakob de Haan, David-Jan Jansen","abstract":"","linkarticle":"https://www.dnb.nl/publicaties/publicaties-onderzoek/working-paper-2022/744-central-bank-communication-ith-the-general-public-promise-or-false-hope/","centralbank":"De Nederlandsche Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 May 2022"},{"id":639,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The Wealth Distribution and Redistributive Preferences: Evidence from a Randomized Survey Experiment","authors":"Nicol\xe1s Albacete, Pirmin Fessler, Peter Lindner","abstract":"The abstract couldn\'t be scraped easily from the website.","linkarticle":"https://www.oenb.at/dam/jcr:f551a3bf-cd08-4212-8cb2-9fd059342401/WP239.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Austria","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":640,"date":"April 29, 2022","day":29,"month":4,"year":2022,"title":"High Performance Export Portfolio: Design Growth-Enhancing Export Structure with Machine Learning","authors":"Natasha Che, Xuege Zhang","abstract":"This paper studies the relationship between export structure and growth performance.

Bitcoin has emerged as the most popular among them, with a total valuation that reached an all-time high of $68,000 in November 2021. However, its price has historically been subject to large and abrupt fluctuations, as the sudden drop in the months that followed once again proved. Since bitcoin looks all set to continue growing while largely concentrating its activity in unregulated environments, concerns have been raised among authorities all over the world about its potential impact on financial stability, monetary policy, and the integrity of the financial system. As a result, building a sound and proper regulatory and supervisory framework to address these challenges hinges upon achieving a better understanding of both the critical underlying factors that influence the formation of bitcoin prices and the stability of such factors over time. In this article we analyse which variables determine the price at which bitcoin is traded on the most relevant exchanges. To this end, we use a flexible machine learning model, specifically a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, to establish the price of bitcoin as a function of a number of economic, technological and investor attention variables. Our LSTM model replicates reasonably well the behaviour of the price of bitcoin over different periods of time. We then use an interpretability technique known as SHAP to understand which features most influence the LSTM outcome. We conclude that the importance of the different variables in bitcoin price formation changes substantially over the period analysed. Moreover, we find that not only does their influence vary, but also that new explanatory factors often seem to appear over time that, at least for the most part, were initially unknown.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2215e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 April 2022"},{"id":649,"date":"April 8, 2022","day":8,"month":4,"year":2022,"title":"The Return of Expansionary Austerity: Firms\u2019 Investment Response to Fiscal Adjustments in Emerging Markets","authors":"Nicolas Magud, Samuel Pienknagura","abstract":"We study the response of corporate investment in Emerging Markets to unexpected fiscal shocks.

It is now evident that COVID-19 will be with us for the long term, and there are very different scenarios for how it could evolve, from a mild endemic scenario to a dangerous variant scenario. This realization calls for a new strategy that manages both the uncertainty and the long-term risks of COVID-19. There are four key policy implications of such as strategy. First, we need to achieve equitable access beyond vaccines to encompass a comprehensive toolkit. Second, we must monitor the evolving virus and dynamically upgrade the toolkit. Third, we must transition from the acute response to a sustainable strategy toward COVID-19, balanced and integrated with other health and social priorities. Fourth, we need a unified risk-mitigation approach to future infectious disease threats beyond COVID-19. Infectious diseases with pandemic potential are a threat to global economic and health security.

Accordingly, it should allocate additional funding to fight pandemics and strengthen health systems both domestically and overseas.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused large disruptions of traditional work arrangements and has provided new incentives for firms to speed up the adoption of new technologies. How exactly do firms respond to these incentives? We study technology adoption by comparing the evolution of online postings for technology-related jobs with that of postings for other occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.\\nUsing text analytics and a large, unstructured dataset collected on the employment website Indeed, we identify job postings for different occupations. We classify these occupations according to whether they are in the area of digital infrastructure, whether they can be performed remotely and whether they are at risk of automation. We then study how changes in pandemic containment policies that vary by province affect these groups of job postings.\\nWe find that job postings for occupations related to digital infrastructure and that allow for remote work decline less during lockdowns and rebound quicker during reopenings than postings for more traditional occupations. Postings for jobs with both low and high risk of automation appear to evolve similarly during lockdowns, but those for jobs with a low risk recover faster during reopenings. Jobs with a higher representation of women and low-income individuals get relatively few postings if they are not linked to new technologies. Technology adoption as a result of the COVID-19 containment policies as documented in the findings may affect current and future productivity.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/4/staff-working-paper-2022-17","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 April 2022"},{"id":655,"date":"2022-04-04","day":4,"month":4,"year":2022,"title":"Exports and the Exchange Rate: A General Equilibrium Perspective","authors":"Alexander, Patrick, Reza, Abeer","abstract":"How do a country\u2019s exports change when its currency depreciates?

First, since the previous version of the model, the underlying nomenclature used at the European level (ECOICOP) to define some of the main aggregates was changed, therefore requiring a careful review of the relevance of initial equations. Second, in the context of the modification in 2019 of the main semi-structural macroeconomic model used for the macroeconomic projections at Banque de France (FR-BDF), it aims at harmonizing the iterations between MAPI and FR-BDF. Finally, large variations in the wage variables in the midst of the sanitary measures related to the Covid-19 pandemics pushed us to use different concepts of wage and compensation variables. At the crossroads of these considerations, we update the model extending the estimation window, correcting specifications and input variables whenever relevant. The resulting model is an up-to-date, simplified and more parsimonious version of the initial model, entailing a stronger harmonization with the central macroeconomic model FR-BDF.

As banks put more weight on mark-to-market gains, they find it optimal to refrain from revealing information about adverse shocks. Consequently, default risk is mispriced, and loan volumes, and thus investment, are not appropriately reduced. Overinvestment lowers the price of capital, leading households to increase consumption without decreasing labour supply, generating a boom. Due to mispricing, banks subsequently face bigger losses and capital depletion. Output then decreases sharply due to credit supply shortages. In a model calibrated to the US economy, these instances of market dysfunction are crucial in amplifying credit cycles.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2214e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 March 2022"},{"id":664,"date":"28/03/2022","day":28,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"The propagation of worldwide sector-specific shocks","authors":"Mario Izquierdo, Enrique Moral-Benito, Elvira Prades and Javier Quintana","abstract":"This paper analyses the aggregate impact of industry-specific shocks and their propagation through global production networks.

For that purpose, we highlight the importance of departing from standard linear models that assume unitary elasticities of substitution. We combine a theoretical framework of production networks with arbitrary elasticities of substitution (Baqaee & Farhi, 2019) and we make use of World Input-Output Database to account for international linkages. This setting illustrates how, in the presence of production input complementarities, the interaction between simultaneous shocks has significant non-linear effects on sectoral composition and aggregate output. The aggregate impact of negative (positive) shocks gets significantly amplified (mitigated) when they affect simultaneously industries with strong production linkages. Our results show that ignoring production complementarities leads to vastly underestimating the aggregate consequences of regulatory or technological shocks in industries like chemicals or vehicle manufacturing. In contrast, simultaneous shocks to services industries are well accounted for by standard measures.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2213e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 March 2022"},{"id":665,"date":"March 25, 2022","day":25,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Supply Chains and Port Congestion Around the World","authors":"Andras Komaromi, Diego Cerdeiro, Yang Liu","abstract":"Rising prices and reports of empty shelves in major economies have drawn attention to the functioning of supply chains that normally operate smoothly in the background. Among the issues, the long delays that port congestion may have caused in delivering goods to consumers and firms have been gathering increasing attention. We shed light on these issues leveraging a unique data set on maritime transport. Two main features emerge. First, at the world level, we find that shipping times jumped upwards as soon as the COVID crisis hit, and after a marked acceleration from end-2020, delays surpassed 1.5 days on average by December 2021 \u2013 or roughly a 25 percent increase in global travel times. The estimated additional days in transit for the average shipment in December 2021 can be compared to an ad-valorem tariff of 0.9 to 3.1 percent. The midpoint of this range is approximately equal, in absolute value, to the global applied tariff reduction achieved over the 14-year period from 2003 to 2017. Second, not all congestion appears related to increased demand. Many ports, especially since mid-2021, exhibit longer wait times despite handling less cargo than pre-pandemic. Infrastructure upgrading is therefore likely a necessary, but not sufficient condition for building resilience during a crisis where other factors (such as labor shortages) may also become binding.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/03/25/Supply-Chains-and-Port-Congestion-Around-the-World-515673","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 March 2022"},{"id":666,"date":"March 25, 2022","day":25,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Social Versus Individual Work Preferences: Implications for Optimal Income Taxation","authors":"Zhiyong An, David Coady","abstract":"The benchmark optimal income taxation model of Mirrlees (1971) finds that the optimal marginal income tax rate (MIT) is always non-negative.

We show that these practices will arise only when retailers have some bargaining power. When the bargaining power lies entirely with the manufacturer, obscuring prices does not occur.

Usually portrayed as workers climbing the job ladder, the notion of the on-the-job search has proven very successful at interpreting and rationalizing the body of empirical evidence on individual labour market turnover and wage dynamics. At the aggregate level, this turnover is a major force moving workers across firms, occupations and locations, with profound effects on productivity growth. At an individual level, the process constitutes an important source of wage growth.\\nI build a heterogeneous agent incomplete market model with rich labour market dynamics that give rise to a job ladder structure. Workers move slowly toward more productive and better-paying jobs through job-to-job transitions, while negative shocks occasionally throw them back into unemployment. The entire distribution of workers over savings, earnings and jobs is part of the state of the economy, and it shifts in response to aggregate shocks.\\nI calibrate the model to the US economy and use it to explore the role of the ladder during the US Great Recession period and its aftermath.

They amalgamate a broad range of fundamentally different factors, creating ambiguity for investors as to the signals of higher or lower ESG scores. We explore the feasibility and performance of more targeted investment strategies based on specific categories by deconstructing ESG scores into their granular components. First, we investigate the characteristics of the various categories underlying ESG scores. Not all types of ESG categories lend themselves to more targeted strategies, which is related to both limits to ESG data disclosure and the fundamental challenge of translating qualitative characteristics into quantitative measures. Second, we consider an investment scheme based on the exclusion of firms with the lowest scores in each category of interest. In most cases, this targeted strategy still allows investors to substantially improve the portfolio headline ESG score, with only a marginal impact on financial performance relative to a broad stock market benchmark. The exclusion results in regional and sectoral biases relative to the benchmark, which may be undesirable for some investors. We then implement a \\"best-in-class\\" strategy, based on excluding firms with the lowest category scores and reinvesting the proceeds in firms with the highest scores maintaining the same regional and sectoral composition. This approach reduces the tracking error of the portfolio and slightly improves its risk-adjusted performance while still yielding a large gain in the headline ESG score.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1008.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"9 March 2022"},{"id":698,"date":"08/03/2022","day":8,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Inflation Targeting or Fiscal Activism?","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-412-inflation-targeting-or-fiscal-activism.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"8 March 2022"},{"id":699,"date":"07 March 2022","day":7,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Cross-border regulatory spillovers and macroprudential policy coordination","authors":"Pierre-Richard Ag\xe9nor, Timothy Jackson, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva","abstract":"A core-periphery model with financial frictions, imperfect financial integration, and cross-border banking is used to assess the magnitude of regulatory spillovers and the gains from international macroprudential policy coordination.

Welfare gains associated with countercyclical capital buffers are calculated for three policy regimes: independent policies (Nash), coordination, and reciprocity---a regime in which capital ratios set in the core are imposed on branches operating in the periphery.

On the other hand, inequality has been rising in major developed economies since the 1980s. This could amplify the impact of a recession by affecting poor households more than their wealthier counterparts. Despite the importance of both trends, the interacting implications they may have on different frameworks are not fully understood.\\nMotivated by these observations, we study the ranking of monetary policy frameworks that consider\xa0 inequality and a low interest rate environment. We use a macroeconomic model that reflects some key elements of income risk in Canada. This model reveals that a trade-off exists between low and stable inflation and higher consumption inequality.\\nFirst, we find that price-level targeting (PLT) is relatively better than other alternative policies at stabilizing business cycles. Second, we show that the performance of PLT deteriorates compared with average inflation targeting (AIT) and IT if the central bank places a large weight on consumption inequality. This is because PLT generates additional volatility in output to bring the price level back to target. Volatile output leads directly to larger fluctuations in consumption inequality.

They use the application to read news or posts from friends. At the same time, the social media app learns about the consumer by analyzing their profile and monitoring their browsing habits. The more actively the consumer uses the service, the more data the app can collect, which often means a better experience for the consumer and higher revenue for the service.\\nThe consumer faces a trade-off: On the one hand, they enjoy the benefits of using social media, such as socializing with friends. On the other hand, the consumer also values their privacy and is concerned about the risk of data leakage, identity theft or other potential abuses of personal information. If the consumer thinks the privacy cost of using the app is high, they will reduce their activity on the platform.\\nThis paper develops a dynamic game-theoretic model that analyzes the interaction between a consumer\u2019s incentive to protect privacy and a platform\u2019s incentive to collect data. The platform can encourage the consumer to use the service more actively by employing a certain privacy policy. The key idea is that when the consumer has low privacy on a platform, the marginal cost to the consumer of giving up more privacy is low. Thus, data collection reduces the consumer\'s welfare but increases their incentive to keep using the service.\\nThe paper shows that the platform can collect a lot of data even if the consumer is sensitive to privacy. To do so, the platform initially offers high privacy protection to encourage the consumer to use the platform; however, as time goes by, the platform gradually degrades privacy protection. In the long run, the consumer will lose privacy but keep a high activity level, and the platform typically offers negligible privacy protection.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/3/staff-working-paper-2022-8","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 March 2022"},{"id":703,"date":"2022-03-04","day":4,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Central Bank Liquidity Facilities and Market Making","authors":"Cimon, David, Walton, Adrian","abstract":"In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 led to turmoil in financial markets around the world. Behind this turmoil was the need by large asset managers to convert assets to cash to meet redemptions and margin calls. As a result, large volumes of fixed-income securities were sold to investment dealers who had limited ability or risk tolerance to purchase them. Many previously liquid markets either became illiquid or seized altogether. To calm markets, central banks, including the Bank of Canada, intervened on a historically large scale and scope using several measures, including asset purchase programs.\xa0\xa0\\nWe create a theoretical model of central bank asset purchases. This model enhances our understanding of how asset purchases ease pressures on investment dealers.

This tension creates the risk of a shift away from the conventional arrangement to one in which monetary policy becomes mostly subordinate to fiscal policy decisions. We study how this risk affects the design of monetary policy. We use a model with both a monetary and a fiscal authority that interact non-cooperatively and have different degrees of commitment.\\nSpecifically, we examine whether a central bank should design a monetary policy framework that prescribes acting conditionally on how fiscal policy behaves. We find that such a framework not only improves economic outcomes by providing appropriate incentives to the fiscal authority but also may enhance the central bank\u2019s credibility.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/3/staff-working-paper-2022-11","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 March 2022"},{"id":706,"date":"March 4, 2022","day":4,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"The Nexus Between Public Enterprise Governance, Financial Performance, and Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities: An Application to Moldova","authors":"Amgad Hegazy, Arturo Navarro","abstract":"Strong governance frameworks for public enterprises have long been an anchor of stability and efficiency underpinning their financial operations and performance.

This paper provides empirical evidence for the existence of widespread risk-taking incentives in the investment fund sector, with a particular focus on incentives for synchronised, cyclical risk-taking which could have systemic effects. Incentives arise from the positive response of investors to returns achieved through cyclical risk-taking and non-linearities in the relationship between fund returns and fund flows, which may keep managers from fully internalising the effects of adverse outcomes on their portfolios.

The model matches remarkably well the short and long run dynamics of skilled and unskilled workers. Skill mismatch and skill-specific labour market institutions have three main effects on business cycles and growth dynamics. First, as the composition of labour market skills leads to supply segmentation, the relative scarcity of skilled workers increases the natural rate of unemployment and reduces total factor productivity with long-run effects on the growth rate of output. Second, skill heterogeneity in the labour market generates asymmetric outcomes and ampli.es measures of employment, wages and consumption inequality. Finally, the model provides important insights for the Phillips and Beveridge curves. Skill-specific labour market heterogeneity leads to a flattening of the Phillips curve as wages and unemployment are affected differently across skill types.

However, with the end of the commodity boom in 2014, fiscal deficits have grown and reserves have fallen. One route to restoring long-run sustainability would be to combine fiscal consolidation with a switch to a floating exchange rate. However, a preference for maintaining the peg could be accommodated with adjustments elsewhere in the policy framework. Employing a detailed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the Bolivian economy, this study assesses the long-run sustainability and relative benefits of alternative policy combinations, and calculates optimal adjustment paths for the transition from the present situation to the steady state. It concludes that continued adherence to a fixed-rate regime, while not optimal, is feasible, if supported by a larger fiscal effort.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/02/25/Fix-vs-513587","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 February 2022"},{"id":726,"date":"February 25, 2022","day":25,"month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Are Low-Skill Women Being Left Behind?

We examine the contribution of job polarization to this trend by estimating age, period, and cohort effects for the likelihood of employment in different occupations and the wages earned therein over 2001-2019. For recent generations of women, cohort effects indicate a higher likelihood of employment in low-paying manual jobs relative to high-paying abstract jobs. However, cohort effects also underpin falling wages for post-1980 cohorts across all occupations. We find that falling returns to labor rather than job polarization has been a key driver of rising inter-age wage inequality among low-skill females.

In many countries, laws often reflect and perpetuate gender norms that limit women\u2019s economic participation, and removal of these impediments through legal reform has been shown to be an effective method to catalyze greater participation of women in the economy\u2014along with the related macroeconomic benefits. Once legal barriers are removed and provisions for more equal treatment under the law are embedded, the law can also be employed as a powerful tool to incentivize women to pursue equal opportunities, change mindsets regarding the role of women, and hold institutions and individuals accountable for achieving results. Accordingly, it is imperative for countries to focus on eliminating existing legal impediments and designing appropriate incentives to increase women\u2019s participation in the economy. This paper goes beyond previous Fund work by categorizing the key sources of laws that impede women\u2019s economic empowerment, as well as ways in which the law can be used as a tool to create behavioral changes and shifts in perceptions of women in the economy. Case studies of six countries (Iceland, Peru, Rwanda, The Philippines, Tunisia, and the United States) that rank high in gender equality in their respective regions demonstrate how legal reforms have been implemented in differing contexts to help achieve women\u2019s economic empowerment. Given the relevance to the Fund\u2019s mandate, the paper also notes the case for a stepped-up role for the IMF in advising on legal reforms that remove barriers to, and incentivize, women\u2019s economic empowerment.

These differences in elasticities contribute significantly to the unequal welfare effects of large import price changes.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1001.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 February 2022"},{"id":747,"date":"16 February 2022","day":16,"month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Exorbitant privilege?

The indicators show that new sectoral regulation in Spain is increasing over time, but there are significant differences both between sectors and between Autonomous Regions. Thus, the services and agricultural sectors are relatively more frequently regulated than the industrial ones. On a temporal scale, it is possible to observe that regulators pass new regulations more frequently in downturns. This trend is particularly noticeable in 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the recreational, hospitality, commerce and textile industry sectors.

The model can account for a 2.2 percentage point (pp) decline in r\u2217 between 1975 and 2015, which is within the range of empirical estimates. Rising income inequality is an important driver (-0.70 pp), and together with demographic change (-0.71 pp) and the slowdown in productivity growth (-1.0 pp) explains most of the decline. Growing public debt is the major counteracting force (+0.31 pp). Permanent income inequality is of greater importance than inequality due to uninsurable income risk, and matching the degree of nonhomotheticity in consumption and savings behavior to empirical estimates is essential for this result. We predict that r\u2217 will reach a low of 0.38% by 2030, after which a slow reversal will begin. The natural rate will stabilize at 1% in the long run, a low level when compared with the postwar path of r\u2217 implied by the model.

The importance of the dollar exchange rate represents a strong piece of evidence of dominant currency pricing (DCP) in the international trade of services and suggests that the benefits of exchange rate flexibility for tourism-dependent countries may be weaker than previously thought.","linkarticle":"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/02/04/Exchange-Rate-Elasticities-of-International-Tourism-and-the-Role-of-Dominant-Currency-511835","centralbank":"International Monetary Fund","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 February 2022"},{"id":773,"date":"February 4, 2022","day":4,"month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Falling Use of Cash and Demand for Retail Central Bank Digital Currency","authors":"Tanai Khiaonarong, David Humphrey","abstract":"Cash use in most countries is falling slowly.

Consistent with a strengthened collateral lending channel, entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise. In line with the model\'s implications, higher startup activity does not diminish startup quality.

The model features a number of occasionally binding constraints. The interactions between these constraints - in particular leverage and liquidity constraints - are key in determining macroeconomic outcomes. We find that both secured and unsecured money market frictions force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to de-lever, which leads to less lending and output. If the liquidity constraint is very tight, the leverage constraint may turn slack. In this case, there are large declines in lending and output.

This paper proposes a structural explanation for the divergence, based on the growth of global supply chains, and suggests that this divergence might be a persistent phenomenon. The key idea is that, as vertical specialization continues (i.e., with an increase in the average number of production stages in the world economy), more intermediate goods enter the national PPI basket. As a result, the common component in the two price indexes\u2014domestically consumed final goods that are also domestically produced\u2014has a smaller share in the PPI basket.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/1/staff-working-paper-2022-5","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"26 January 2022"},{"id":800,"date":"25/01/2022","day":25,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"The low-carbon transition, climate commitments and firm credit risk","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-409-the-low-carbon-transition-climate-commitments-and-firm-credit-risk.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 January 2022"},{"id":801,"date":"25 January 2022","day":25,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Capital flows and institutions","authors":"Deniz Igan, Alexandre R Lauwers, Damien Puy","abstract":"Does foreign capital improve the quality of domestic institutions?

To do so, we decompose the long-term interest rate into its two components: the expected shortterm interest rate and the term premium. The first component is obtained using different methodologies, two affine models and data on interest rate swaps. The second component is computed as the difference between long-term interest rates and such short-term rate. The Mexican term premium is represented by the average of the three estimations. We find that the Mexican term premium increased considerably during three episodes compared to the entire dynamics of said premium: i) the Global Financial Crisis of 2008; ii) the Taper Tantrum of 2013; and iii) the U.S. presidential election of 2016. In contrast, we find that the Mexican term premium decreased, to historically low levels, during the U.S. Quantitative Easing and Operation Twist programs. Additionally, in order to identify the main determinants that explain the behavior of this premium, we run a time varying parameters regression. In this analysis, we find that the main determinants that explain the dynamics of the premium are the compensation for FX risk (as a proxy of inflationary risk premium), the real compensation, and the U.S. term premium (as a global factor).","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work993.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 January 2022"},{"id":805,"date":"01/21/2022","day":21,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Make-up Strategies with Finite Planning Horizons but Forward-Looking Asset Prices","authors":"By Dupraz St\xe9phane, Le Bihan Herv\xe9, Matheron Julien","abstract":"How effective make-up strategies are depends heavily on how forward-looking agents are. Workhorse monetary models, which are much forward-looking, find them so effective that they run into the so-called \u201cforward-guidance puzzle\u201d. Models that discount the future further find them much less effective, but imply that agents discount the very perception of future policy rates. This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We amend one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle -namely Woodford\'s finite planning horizons -to the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting. Second, we find that make-up strategies that always respond to past economic conditions, such as average inflation targeting, do too but that their stabilization benefits over IT can be reduced by the existence of the ELB.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/make-strategies-finite-planning-horizons-forward-looking-asset-prices","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"21 January 2022"},{"id":806,"date":"January 21, 2022","day":21,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Structural Breaks in Carbon Emissions: A Machine Learning Analysis","authors":"Jiaxiong Yao, Yunhui Zhao","abstract":"To reach the global net-zero goal, the level of carbon emissions has to fall substantially at speed rarely seen in history, highlighting the need to identify structural breaks in carbon emission patterns and understand forces that could bring about such breaks.

LAC countries could strengthen their PIT to mobilize revenue and improve progressivity by addressing critical design flaws. Possible adverse growth effects could be mitigated by providing incentives to labor force participation and formalization (e.g., through earned-income tax credits). The ongoing global corporate income tax reforms present a great opportunity to reassess thoroughly the CIT in LAC.

Finally, we provide evidence that Spanish individuals experienced moderate declines in their levels of psychological well-being.

The adjustment is gradual: the full pass through takes about 3 weeks. In a broad class of sticky price models, the ratio of the kurtosis over the frequency of price changes is shown to be a sufficient statistic for the cumulative impulse response of prices (CIRP) to a nominal shock. We provide evidence that the sufficient statistic prediction holds when we look at how gasoline prices respond to a common cost shock. Relating, at the gas station level, the CIRP to moments of the price change distribution, we find that the CIRP correlates with the ratio of kurtosis over frequency, but also with both frequency and kurtosis taken separately. The sign and the magnitude of the correlations are fully in line with theoretical predictions.

Our estimation framework applied to GDP-linked warrants issued by Argentina, Greece, and Ukraine reveals three stylized facts: (i) the risk premium in state-contingent instruments is high and persistent; (ii) the risk premium exhibits a pro-cyclical pattern; and (iii) the liquidity premium is higher and more volatile than that for plain-vanilla government bonds issued by the same sovereign. We then present a model in which investors fear ambiguity and that can account for the cyclical properties of the risk premium.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work988.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"12 January 2022"},{"id":825,"date":"11 January 2022","day":11,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Savings, efficiency and bank runs","authors":"Agnese Leonello, Caterina Mendicino, Ettore Panetti, Davide Porcellacchia","abstract":"Does the level of deposits matter for bank fragility and efficiency? By augmenting a standard model of endogenous bank runs with a consumption-saving decision, we obtain two novel results. First, depositors\u2019 incentives to run are a function of the level of savings held as bank deposits. Second, a saving externality emerges in that individual depositors do not internalize the effect of their saving decisions on the bank-run probability. As a result, the economy features an inefficient level of savings and bank liquidity provision as well as excessive bank fragility. These results are robust to different sources of bank fragility, as they emerge both when runs are panic- and fundamental-driven.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2636~919f4a1ecd.en.pdf?a9f90bed5043281e2918fb0c388cc2b0","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"11 January 2022"},{"id":826,"date":"11 January 2022","day":11,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Zombies on the brink: Evidence from Japan on the reversal of monetary policy effectiveness","authors":"Gee Hee Hong, Deniz Igan, Do Lee","abstract":"How does unconventional monetary policy affect corporate capital structure and investment decisions?

Using a rich bankfirm matched data of Japanese firms with information on corporate debt and investment, we study how firms adjust their capital structure in response to the changes in term premia. Investment responds positively to a reduction in the term premium on average. However, there is a significant degree of cross-sectional variation in firm response: healthier firms increase capital spending and cash holdings, while financially vulnerable firms take advantage of lower long-term yields to refinance without increasing investment.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work987.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"11 January 2022"},{"id":827,"date":"2022-01-11","day":11,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Firm Inattention and the Efficacy of Monetary Policy: A Text-Based Approach","authors":"Song, Wenting, Stern, Samuel","abstract":"When making production and pricing decisions, firm managers may not have the resources to track, interpret and respond to macroeconomic news. Despite the potential importance of such attention for firm performance, empirically assessing this importance has been challenging. This is because attention is neither easily observable nor quantifiable.\\nWe construct a novel measure of firm attention to macroeconomic news based on their public annual filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. We then use this measure to determine the size of information costs in a model with rationally inattentive firms. We show that output response of inattentive firms is more sensitive to monetary policy than that of attentive firms.\\nThe paper provides some of the first direct evidence of the importance of firm attention to the macroeconomy. We document that more firms pay attention to macroeconomic news during recessions even though most firms appear to always or never pay attention. When they do pay attention to a central bank\u2019s moves during recessions, monetary stimulus has a smaller effect on output.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/1/staff-working-paper-2022-3","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"11 January 2022"},{"id":828,"date":"10/01/2022","day":10,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Dampening the financial accelerator?

Digital platforms operate in multi-sided markets, and rely crucially on big data. This leads to specific network effects, returns to scale and scope, and policy trade-offs. To reap the benefits of platforms while mitigating risks, policy makers can: (i) apply existing financial, antitrust and privacy regulations, (ii) adapt old and adopt new regulations, combining an activity and entity-based approach, and/or (iii) provide new public infrastructures. The latter include digital identity, retail fast payment systems and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These public infrastructures, as well as ex ante competition rules and data portability, are particularly promising. Yet to achieve their policy goals, central banks and financial regulators need to coordinate with competition and data protection authorities.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work986.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"10 January 2022"},{"id":830,"date":"2022-01-10","day":10,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"What Drives Bitcoin Fees?

This paper focuses on ABS backed by auto loans or loans granted to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and explores ways to measure their climate risk based on the characteristics of the underlying loans, using existing loan-level data requirements. The ultimate goal was to come up with an alignment metric, i.e. to judge whether ABS related emissions would meet the Paris Agreements objectives, a task hindered by the lack of data available. Despite these limits, we were able to come up with relevant indicators related to ABS carbon impact, enabling the computation of ABS climate related risk proxies. Without necessarily being able to measure a concrete impact, we carved a series of indicators to serve as a reference. However, we conclude that an improved and harmonized framework for the provision of non-financial information seems essential to achieve an accurate analysis and monitoring of the financial sector\'s exposure to climate change.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/climate-risk-measurement-assets-eligible-collateral-refinancing-operations-focus-asset-backed","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 January 2022"},{"id":832,"date":"January 7, 2022","day":7,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"The Role for Deposit Insurance Funds in Dealing with Failing Banks in the European Union","authors":"Atilla Arda, Marc Dobler","abstract":"This paper argues that in the European Union (EU) deposit insurance funds are too difficult to use in bank resolution and too easy to use outside resolution.

We use the episodes of Taper Tantrum and COVID-19 as risk-off shocks. Our identification relies on a difference-in-differences methodology with country fixed effects where preemptive policies are ex-ante by construction and cannot be put in place as a response to the shock ex-post. We control the effects of other policies, such as monetary policy, foreign exchange interventions (FXI), easing of inflow CFMs and tightening of outflow CFMs that are used in response to the risk-off shocks.
