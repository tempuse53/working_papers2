We use a new estimator for staggered differences-in-differences analysis that extends the local projections approach with clean controls (Dube et al., 2022). We find strong heterogeneity in the magnitude and pattern of the impacts of solar and wind investments. On average, solar investments increase employment by local firms, but the effects on the unemployment of local residents are weak. The effects of wind investments on local employment and unemployment are mostly non-significant.

The paper derives the dynamic IS curve analytically in a model with investment, where the interest rate channel originates both in the the savings decisions of households and the investment decisions of firms. This generalized dynamic IS curve sheds light on several new factors that shape the dependence of aggregate demand on interest rates. In particular, interest rates are discounted in investment and aggregate demand if and only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption (IES) is low enough, and compounded if it is higher. The addition of household heterogeneity can generate discounting in aggregate consumption as well, in a new way that does not rely on precautionary savings. Instead, household heterogeneity creates discounting by making consumption respond to interest rates primarily as a ripple effect of the response of investment, not through intertemporal substitution.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/dynamic-curve-when-there-both-investment-and-savings","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 January 2023"},{"id":7,"date":"24/01/2023","day":24,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Trust and accountability in times of pandemics","authors":"Monica Martinez-Bravo and Carlos Sanz","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic took place against the backdrop of growing political polarization and distrust in political institutions in many countries. Did deficiencies in government performance further erode trust in public institutions? Did citizens\u2019 ideology interfere with the way they processed information on government performance? To investigate these two questions, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment in Spain in November 2020. Respondents in the treatment group were provided information on the number of contact tracers in their region, a key policy variable under the control of regional governments. We find that individuals greatly over-estimate the number of contact tracers in their region. When we provide the actual number of contact tracers, we find a decline in trust in governments, a reduction in willingness to fund public institutions and a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We also find that individuals endogenously change their attribution of responsibilities when receiving the treatment. In regions where the regional and central governments are controlled by different parties, sympathizers of the regional incumbent react to the negative news on performance by attributing greater responsibility for it to the central government. We call this the blame shifting effect. In those regions, the negative information does not translate into lower voting intentions for the regional incumbent government. These results suggest that the exercise of political accountability may be particularly difficult in settings with high political polarization and areas of responsibility that are not clearly delineated.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2306e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 January 2023"},{"id":8,"date":"01/24/2023","day":24,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Measuring and Comparing Consumption Inequality between France and the United States","authors":"By Aliocha Accardo, Herbert Sylv\xe9rie, Jude Cristina, Penalver Adrian","abstract":"This paper constructs an annual dataset of consumption by income quintiles for France since 1989 in order to make a granular comparison of consumption inequality with the United States. First, we match consumption data from a survey run every five years with the national accounts, and then use a Kalman filter to interpolate missing observations, leveraging the yearly national accounts data to improve the performance of the Kalman filter. We validate this technique by applying it to a US dataset with pseudo-missing data comparable with our French data. Second, we construct a US consumption dataset compatible with the French classification of consumption items and compare consumption inequality trends between the US and France. We find consumption inequality to be overall lower than income inequality, and not to follow the dynamics of income inequality. Consumption inequality is also higher in the US than in France. Finally, based on the weights of the different consumption items, we construct annual consumption deflators by quintiles. We find that dispersion in price pressures across income groups is less marked in France than in the United States, and overall quite small in both countries.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/measuring-and-comparing-consumption-inequality-between-france-and-united-states","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"24 January 2023"},{"id":9,"date":"23/01/2023","day":23,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"A house price-at-risk model to monitor the downside risk for the Spanish housing market","authors":"Gergely Ganics and Mar\xeda Rodr\xedguez-Moreno","abstract":"We present a house price-at-risk (HaR) model that fits the historical developments in the Spanish housing market.

In particular, the model features sector interactions along several dimensions in an open economy setting, either in the provision of intermediate inputs and capital goods or competing in the labour market. This framework is flexible enough to provide insights into the effect of several policy-relevant shocks, such as global value chain bottlenecks, increases in production costs in energy-intensive sectors or large public investment programmes. In order to illustrate the role of such sectoral interactions, we consider a sectorisation of Next Generation EU (NGEU) funds based on Spain\u2019s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP) which will mobilize \u20ac69.5 bn in grants. According to our findings, the average impact over a 5-year horizon is 1.15% of GDP if we consider only the direct effect of the investment programmes and expenditure plans, but it increases to 1.75% if we take into account the increase in the productive capacity of certain sectors and its propagation through the production network.

While a series of policy actions seemingly have served well to rein in bankruptcies in the short run, more than a few have remarked that the facility measures could hamper business dynamics and distort resource allocation in the medium to long run.Based on these discussions, this paper provides a literature survey of existing studies on the effects of corporate facility measures of banks and governments on resource allocation in the economy. It mainly focuses on Japan after the collapse of its bubble economy, European countries after the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crises, China under debt expansion, and developed countries during the spread of COVID-19. We also identify so-called \\"zombie firms,\\" which survive with banks\' and governments\' support despite performing poorly without the prospect of recovery, using firms\' financial data. We set the criteria of the zombie firms by arranging methodologies proposed by the existing studies. The analysis shows that the number of zombie firms surged after the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990s in Japan. It decreased in the early 2000s and remained relatively lower in recent years for both large and small-and-medium enterprises. At least based on the currently available data in fiscal 2020 after the spread of COVID-19, we do not detect a problematic growth in the number of zombie firms as in the 1990s. Still, we need to be cautious about the development of zombie firms because we have data constraints on the recent data.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2023/wp23e01.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 January 2023"},{"id":14,"date":"19 January 2023","day":19,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"The Bank of Amsterdam and the limits of fiat money","authors":"Wilko Bolt, Jon Frost, Hyun Song Shin, Peter Wierts","abstract":"Central banks can operate with negative equity, and many have done so in history without undermining trust in fiat money.

A range of DeFi protocols implements these services as a suite of smart contracts, ie software programs that encode the logic of conventional financial operations. Instead of transacting with a counterparty, DeFi users thus interact with software programs that pool the resources of other DeFi users to maintain control over their funds. This paper provides a deep dive into the overall architecture, the technical primitives, and the financial functionalities of DeFi protocols. We analyse and explain the individual components and how they interact through the lens of a DeFi stack reference (DSR) model featuring three layers: settlement, applications and interfaces. We discuss the technical aspects of each layer of the DSR model. Then, we describe the financial services for the most relevant DeFi categories, ie decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, derivatives protocols and aggregators. The latter exploit the property that smart contracts can be \\"composed\\", ie utilize the functionalities of other protocols to provide novel financial services.

Overall, the evidence points to expansionary monetary policy decreasing capital misallocation mainly through the relaxation of financial frictions of incumbent, productive, constrained firms.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/23/Files/dt2302e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 January 2023"},{"id":19,"date":"13 January 2023","day":13,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"Monetary policy and credit card spending","authors":"Francesco Grigoli, Damiano Sandri","abstract":"We analyze the impact of monetary policy on consumer spending using confidential credit card data.

Furthermore, the model offers clear, testable predictions about policy and corresponding consequences. In the US data, stricter retention rules caused banks to monitor and shift risk simultaneously.

The simulation procedure, though demonstrated in the realm of payments systems, has tremendous potential for helping with data-deficient problems where only high-level aggregate information is available. The approach uses the concept of integer composition in combinatorics to break down the daily total value and volume (available) into individual data points (unavailable) throughout the day. The algorithm also introduces a technique to incorporate any intraday timing pattern (known or hypothetical) to make simulated data closer to reality. Simulation results show that the probability distribution of individual payment values is remarkably stable through repeated random sampling. This suggests a high degree of accuracy and viability of this simulation method. In addition, the densities of simulated intraday transactions are found to be invariably skewed to the left of the mean payment value, which reflects the nature of retail payments systems.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2023/1/staff-working-paper-2023-1","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 January 2023"},{"id":26,"date":"03/01/2023","day":3,"month":1,"year":2023,"title":"The forgotten lender: the role of multilateral lenders in sovereign debt and default","authors":"Mar\xeda Bru Mu\xf1oz","abstract":"The role of multilateral lenders in sovereign default has been traditionally overlooked by the literature.

Naive consumers also follow a sub-optimal balance-matching heuristic when repaying their credit cards, incurring higher costs.

In the following months, however, economic activity remained sluggish while equity markets bounced back. This disconnect between equity values and macro-variables can be partially explained by other factors, namely the decline in risk-free interest rates, and -for the US- the strong profitability of the IT sector. As a result, an econometrician forecasting economic activity with aggregate stock market variables during the Covid-crisis is likely to get poor results. Our main contribution is thus to rely on sectorally disaggregated equity variables within a factor model in order to predict US economic activity. We find, first, that the factor model better predicts future economic activity compared to aggregate equity variables, or to conventional benchmarks used in the literature, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Second, we show that the strong performance of the factor model comes from the fact that it filters out the \u201cexpected returns\u201d component of the sectoral equity variables as well as the foreign component of aggregate future cash flows.

Due to strategic complementarities, more productive firms have higher markups in steady state. This leads to a misallocation distortion, as more productive firms produce too little compared to the social optimum. An increase of steady state inflation curbs the markups, especially those of the more productive firms, hence attenuating the inefficient dispersion of markups. At low levels of inflation, the gains from the reduction in misallocation outweigh the cost of inflation. Heterogeneity in productivity and strategic complementarities in price setting, the key ingredients of our model, imply that also firms\' response to shocks is heterogenous: less productive firms transmit cost shocks to prices much more than more productive ones.

On the other hand, there is room for fund managers and regulators to consider physical risk better and mitigate the second round effects it induces, as they are less efficiently absorbed by investment funds. Improving transparency and setting relevant industry standards in this context would help mitigate short-term financial stability risks.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2757~80ba1bf7dd.en.pdf?ce3db2acd6b153d220d7549c98e041de","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 December 2022"},{"id":64,"date":"16 December 2022","day":16,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"The impact of derivatives collateralisation on liquidity risk: evidence from the investment fund sector","authors":"Audrius Jukonis, Elisa Letizia, Linda Rousov\xe1","abstract":"Stricter derivative margin requirements have increased the demand for liquid collateral but euro area investment funds which use derivatives extensively have been reducing their liquid asset holdings.

The second is a neglect of expectations data driven by a strong belief that inflation expectations were firmly anchored and so inflation increases would be temporary. The third is an over-reliance on the credibility earned in the past, creating an illusion of too much room to focus on the recovery of real activity and underpredicting the resulting inflation. The fourth is a revision of strategy that made central banks tolerant of higher inflation because of the trend fall in the return on government bonds, even though the return on private capital stayed high.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1060.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 December 2022"},{"id":66,"date":"16 December 2022","day":16,"month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Cryptocurrencies and Decentralised Finance (DeFi)","authors":"Igor Makarov, Antoinette Schoar","abstract":"The paper provides an overview of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.

We observe a hump-shaped relationship between a country\'s investment rate and its level of development, both within countries over time and across countries. Advanced economies reach their investment peak at a higher level of income and at an earlier point in time relative to emerging markets. We also observe the familiar patterns of structural change (a decline in the agricultural share and an increase in the services share, both relative to manufacturing). The pace of change observed in the 1930 to 1980 period in advanced economies is remarkably similar to that in emerging markets since 1960. Motivated by these facts, we develop a two-region model of the world economy that captures the dynamics of investment and structural change. The regions are isolated from each other up to the point of capital market liberalization in the early 1990s. At that point, capital flows from advanced economies to emerging markets and accelerates the process of structural change in emerging markets. Both regions gain from the liberalization of financial markets, but the majority of the gains accrue to the emerging economies. The overall magnitude of gains depends on the date of liberalization, the relative sizes of the two regions and the degree of asymmetry between the two regions at the point of liberalization. Finally, we consider the impact of a \\"second wave\\" of liberalization when China fully opens its economy to capital inflows.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/a-north-south-model-of-structural-change-and-growth.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" December 2022"},{"id":85,"date":"December 2022","day":"  ","month":12,"year":2022,"title":"Understanding the Strength of the Dollar","authors":"Zhengyang Jiang, Robert Richmond, and Tony Zhang","abstract":"We link the sustained appreciation of the U.S. dollar from 2011 to 2019 to international capital flows driven by primitive economic factors.

The model generates term premia that are on average positive with sizable countercyclical variation that arises endogenously. Importantly, demand shocks, in addition to supply shocks, play a key role in the dynamics of term premia. This is in sharp contrast to existing DSGE term structure models with perfect information, which tend to rely on large supply shocks to generate timevariation in yields and term premia. With imperfect information, a shock to productivity is a supply shock, while a shock to signals about productivity that do not lead to actual changes in productivity acts as a demand shock. Nevertheless, an increase in economic activity generates more information about productivity, regardless of which type of shock it arises from. Moreover, a decrease in economic uncertainty leads to a decline in term premia as longer-term bonds are risky on average. This feature helps reconcile the empirical evidence that term premia have been on average positive and countercyclical, with numerous studies pointing to demand shocks as being an important driver of business cycles over the last few decades.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/equilibrium-yield-curves-with-imperfect-information.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" December 2022"},{"id":92,"date":"December 2022","day":"  ","month":12,"year":2022,"title":"How sensitive is the economy to large interest rate increases?

We show that large TARGET balances can only arise with excess liquidity. The interpretation of TARGET balances therefore depends on the monetary policy context in which excess liquidity is created. We distinguish three phases of TARGET balances growth and propose some easy-to-derive metrics for policy makers and academics to assess developments in TARGET balances. We develop a comprehensive econometric framework to account for relevant factors driving TARGET balances in the different phases. We find that while financial market stress and economic imbalances were the drivers of TARGET balances during the great financial and sovereign debt crises, the implementation of Eurosystem asset purchases was the driving force since March 2015.

Government-imposed lockdowns created severe supply bottlenecks in some sectors of the economy, and physical distancing led to dramatic changes in patterns of consumer spending. Some sectors of the economy\u2014such as online retail\u2014benefited, while many others\u2014such as restaurants and travel\u2014struggled to deal with losses of customers and the constraints of lockdowns and remote work. In reaction to this, many governments quickly implemented large fiscal support packages for households and firms.\\nIn this paper, we investigate whether fiscal policy was able to protect firms from failure and stimulate activity in sectors of the economy with slack. We apply two frameworks to the separate questions of (i) did fiscal policy appropriately support firms and (ii) did fiscal policy support economic activity globally? For our first framework, we use firm-level balance-sheet data and a structural model to estimate how firms\u2019 cash flow evolved during the pandemic. In our second framework, we model the global production network using data on 65 countries and 35 sectors. We then investigate to what extent global fiscal stimulus helped countries and their neighbours stimulate economic activity in response to the pandemic.\\nWe find that without any support, an additional 9% of firms would have failed in 2020, but government support to firms lowered that to 4.3%. In advanced economies, support was sufficiently large that failure rates were 0.47% below a typical year, whereas in emerging-market economies (EMEs), which implemented smaller fiscal packages, an additional 9.28% of firms failed even with fiscal support. At the macro level, we find that 70% of sectors in the global economy face supply bottlenecks created by the pandemic and as such, cannot be stimulated with fiscal policy.

In this paper, however, we provide evidence that China constitutes an important driver of the global financial cycle. We argue that because of China\'s importance for global consumption, stronger Chinese growth raises global growth prospects, inducing an increase in global risk sentiment and an expansion in global asset prices and global credit. Two contributions are key to this finding: (1) We construct a measure of China\'s credit impulse to identify Chinese policy-induced demand shocks. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that a primary tool of China\'s stabilization policy-encompassing monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policies-is controlling the amount of credit in the economy. Without China\'s credit impulse, it is difficult to discern global financial spillovers; (2) We estimate an alternative measure of Chinese GDP growth that captures its business cycle given data concerns about the smoothness of official GDP data. Without China\'s alternative GDP measure, it is difficult to attribute any global cycle movements to economic developments in China.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/what-happens-in-china-does-not-stay-in-china.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" November 2022"},{"id":144,"date":"November 2022","day":"  ","month":11,"year":2022,"title":"\\"The Great Retirement Boom\\": The Pandemic-Era Surge in Retirements and Implications for Future Labor Force Participation","authors":"Joshua Montes, Christopher Smith, and Juliana Dajon","abstract":"As of October 2022, the retired share of the U.S. population was nearly 1-1/2 percentage points above its pre-pandemic level (after adjusting for updated population controls to the Current Population Survey), accounting for nearly all of the shortfall in the labor force participation rate. In this paper, we analyze the pandemic-era rise in retirements using a model that accounts for pre-pandemic trends in retirement, the cyclicality of retirement, and other factors. We show that: more than half of the increase in the retired share are \\"excess retirements\\" that would likely not have occurred in the absence of the pandemic; excess retirements have been concentrated among cohorts age 65 and older at the start of the pandemic; excess retirements have been largest among the college-educated and whites; and excess retirements reflect in part that worker transitions from the labor force to retirement remain elevated. We also show that failing to account for updated population controls to the Current Population Survey leads to an underestimate of the rise in the retired share over the last few years. We use a cohort-based framework to argue that looking forward, unless the pandemic has permanently affected retirement behavior, excess retirements should eventually fade as those who retired early during the pandemic reach ages when they would have normally retired. Even as excess retirements fade, the retired share will remain well above its pre-pandemic level, reflecting population aging.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-great-retirement-boom.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" November 2022"},{"id":145,"date":"November 2022","day":"  ","month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Demand Shocks, Hysteresis and Monetary Policy","authors":"Jae Sim","abstract":"This paper builds a micro-founded general equilibrium model of hysteresis in which changing composition of firms with heterogeneous qualities in response to demand shocks alter the total factor productivity of the economy through a process of \\"creative destruction\\".

This paper investigates their welfare effects and quantifies their welfare costs using sufficient statistics. The special role of banks as liquidity providers is embedded in an otherwise standard general equilibrium growth model. Capital and liquidity requirements mitigate moral hazard from deposit insurance, which, if unchecked, can lead to excessive credit and liquidity risk at banks. However, these regulations are also costly because they reduce the ability of banks to create net liquidity and can distort investment. Equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of demand for liquidity, yielding two simple sufficient statistics that express the welfare cost of each requirement as a function of observable variables only. Based on U.S. data, the welfare cost of a 10 percent liquidity requirement is equivalent to a permanent loss in consumption of about 0.02%, a modest impact. Even using a conservative estimate, the cost of a similarly-sized increase in the capital requirement is roughly ten times as large. Even so, optimal policy relies on both requirements, as the \x85financial stability benefi\x85ts of capital requirements are found to be broader.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-welfare-effects-of-bank-liquidity-and-capital-requirements.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" November 2022"},{"id":154,"date":"November 2022","day":"  ","month":11,"year":2022,"title":"Demand Segmentation in the Federal Funds Market","authors":"Manjola Tase","abstract":"This paper outlines a model of demand segmentation in the federal funds market with two types of borrowers - the \\"interest on reserves (IOR) arbitrage\\" type and the \\"regulatory\\" type - which have different reservation prices and cannot always be separated.

We then build a model of firm dynamics with both asset-based and earnings-based borrowing constraints and a government that buys goods and services from private-sector firms, and use it to quantify the long-run macroeconomic consequences of alternative procurement allocation systems. We find that policies that promote the participation of small firms have sizeable macroeconomic effects, but their net impact on aggregate output is ambiguous. These policies help small firms grow and overcome financial constraints, which increases output in the long run. However, they also reduce saving incentives for large firms, decreasing output.

Nevertheless, the real-time dimension of such relationships is less studied, and it remains unclear how to incorporate them in a forecasting framework. This can be partly explained by a certain divide between the economic and political science contributions in this area, as well as by the traditional lack of availability of high-frequency indicators measuring such phenomena. The latter constraint, though, is becoming less of a limiting factor through the production of text-based indicators. In this paper we assemble a dataset of such monthly measures of what we call \u201cinstitutional instability\u201d, for three representative emerging market economies: Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.

Existing empirical literature has only found that carbon pricing schemes are generally associated to a transitory effect on the level of inflation. This paper assesses empirically the effects of carbon pricing on inflation volatility for both carbon tax and cap-and-trade schemes (also known as emission trading systems). Our work finds strong evidence that cap-and-trade schemes are associated with larger volatility in CPI headline inflation, while no significant effect is found in the case of carbon taxes. This effect seems to feed only through the energy component, and does not seem to affect the volatility of core inflation. In addition, we find that under cap-and-trade schemes, both the increase in the underlying price of emissions and the expansion in the activities covered by these initiatives are associated with greater inflation volatility. These findings have important policy implications, given that inflation volatility could complicate the conduct of monetary policy. Since the ambition to mitigate climate change in the years to come is expected to be implemented through broader coverage of carbon pricing, central banks should monitor those developments closely.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2231e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 October 2022"},{"id":188,"date":"03 October 2022","day":3,"month":10,"year":2022,"title":"The scarring effects of deep contractions","authors":"David Aikman, Mathias Drehmann, Mikael Juselius, Xiaochuan Xing","abstract":"We find that deep contractions have highly persistent scarring effects, depressing the level of GDP at least a decade hence.

We summarize core features of a capital regime such as expected and unexpected losses, regulatory ratios and risk-weighted assets, and minimum requirements and buffers, and then consider where climate-related risk drivers may be relevant. We show that when considering policy implications, it is critically important to be precise about how climate change may impact the loss-generating process for banks and to be clear about the specific policy objective. While climate change could potentially impact the regulatory capital regime in several ways, an internally coherent approach requires a strong link between specific assumptions and beliefs about how these financial risks may manifest as bank losses and what objectives regulators are pursuing. We conclude by identifying several potential research opportunities to better understand these complex issues and inform policy development.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/climate-change-and-the-role-of-regulatory-capital.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" October 2022"},{"id":194,"date":"October 2022","day":"  ","month":10,"year":2022,"title":"How Much Does Racial Bias Affect Mortgage Lending?

Insurance premiums (rates) are subject to significant regulations at a state level in the United States. Using novel data on filings made by insurers to regulators, we propose a metric to quantify the extent of regulation in individual states. We provide evidence of decoupling of insurance rates from their underlying risks and identify regulation as a driving force behind this pattern. Rates are least reflective of risk in states we classify as \\"high friction\\", i.e. states where regulations appear most restrictive. We identify two sources behind the decoupling. First, in high friction states, rates have not adequately adjusted in response to the growth in losses. Second, insurers have cross-subsidized high friction states by raising rates in low friction states. Our results imply that households in low friction states are disproportionately bearing the risks of households in high friction states. More broadly, our findings question whether insurance rates can play a useful role in steering climate adaptation and whether households will have continued access to insurance.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/pricing-of-climate-risk-insurance-regulation-and-cross-subsidies.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" October 2022"},{"id":198,"date":"09/30/2022","day":30,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"An Evaluation of the French Innovation Tax Credit","authors":"By Bunel Simon, Hadjibeyli Benjamin","abstract":"The Innovation tax credit (cr\xe9dit d\u2019imp\xf4t innovation, CII) is an extension of the Research tax credit (cr\xe9dit d\u2019imp\xf4t recherche, CIR) intended to boost the incentive effect of the latter on SMEs to encourage them to engage in the creation of new products via the development of prototypes or pilot plants.

They initially looked through the rising inflation by leaving monetary policy relatively unchanged. Then, after inflation continued to increase, central banks pivoted by quickly tightening monetary policy. The pivot was explained, at least in part, as aiming to anchor drifting inflation expectations. Why might central banks want to look through supply-driven inflation sometimes and pivot away at other times? When does a change in monetary policy stance help anchor expectations? When is a strong monetary policy tightening compatible with a soft landing? In this paper we present a simple environment that helps clarify these issues by offering an optimal policy perspective on recent central bank behaviour. In particular, we examine optimal policy in an environment where there is a risk of wage-price spirals and where the central bank views wage- and price-setters as having bounded rationality.

This paper estimates the portfolio overlap - which we define as the correlation of changes in the market value of securities portfolios - between global investment funds and Japanese financial institutions in the last two decades and studies the time series properties and the financial stability implications. There are three main findings. First, the number of financial institutions with a high portfolio overlap with investment funds has increased since before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The increase is particularly prominent for the portfolio overlap between bond funds and regional banks. Second, financial institutions with lower capital ratios, loan-to-deposit ratios, lending margins tend to have a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds. Third, financial institutions with a higher degree of portfolio overlap with investment funds tend to see a larger decline in the market value of the securities portfolio in response to global market shocks such as redemption waves to investment funds, rises in U.S. interest rates, or disruptions in the U.S. bond market. Our results indicate that as secular changes in structural factors such as a decline in the potential growth rate of the home country weigh on the long-term profitability, Japanese financial institutions in particular regional banks have increased investment in foreign securities, making themselves susceptible to global market shocks that arise from the activities of global investment funds even without direct exposure to these funds. Moreover, an increase in the number of financial institutions with a higher portfolio overlap suggests that the impact of such a global market shock may extend over wide areas of the domestic financial system.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e15.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 September 2022"},{"id":231,"date":"14 September 2022","day":14,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Immigrants and the distribution of income and wealth in the euro area: first facts and implications for monetary policy","authors":"Maarten Dossche, Aleksandra Kolndrekaj, Maximilian Propst, Javier Ramos Perez, Jiri Slacalek","abstract":"We use household surveys to describe differences in wages, income, wealth and liquid assets of households born in their country of residence (\u201cnatives\u201d) vs. those born in other EU and non-EU countries (\u201cimmigrants\u201d).

Studies on the measurement of fire sale vulnerabilities in part those associated with NBFIs in a financial system are often conducted at the jurisdiction level using fire-sale (FS) models. While existing studies use granular data to analyze details of fire sale dynamics; in most of these cases, the scope of analysis is focused on a certain jurisdiction or asset class, leaving the cross-jurisdiction or cross-asset spillover dimension out of the scope. To address these points, this paper measures cross-border and cross-asset spillovers of market shocks (\\"interlinkage effect\\") in the GFS using a standard FS model, specifically focusing on the role of NBFIs. With the help of existing FS models, we construct measures of the interlinkage effect across different types of financial institutions, including banks and various types of NBFIs, in Japan\'s financial system as well as those for the foreign financial system (the U.S. and Euro area) using flow of funds data of these jurisdictions. We find that the interlinkage effect has increased substantially, not only for Japan\'s financial system, but also for the overseas financial system since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). These increasing interlinkages of NBFIs with various types of entities suggest there has been a global structural change in the transmission of market shocks.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e14.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"5 September 2022"},{"id":242,"date":"01 September 2022","day":1,"month":9,"year":2022,"title":"Building portfolios of sovereign securities with decreasing carbon footprints","authors":"Gong Cheng, Eric Jondeau, Benoit Mojon","abstract":"We propose a strategy to build portfolios of sovereign securities with progressively declining carbon footprints.

Consumers purchase GAP more often when there is a heightened financial risk: larger credit amounts, longer loan maturities, and lower income levels. More than 90 percent of GAP purchasers report that buying GAP is a good idea and that they would buy it again. Only about 1 percent of surveyed purchasers indicate dissatisfaction with their choice.

My main finding is that expected, rather than current, GDP growth shapes the dynamics of firm entry. Specifically, I find that entry increases with past exits at the sector-level, but only when aggregate GDP growth is forecasted to be strong. Also, with strong growth forecasts, past entry developments weight less on the subsequent sectoral entry dynamics. Periods of low entry and high exit, can therefore be followed by strong entry subsequently, when the economy is expected to grow strongly. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several controls. This includes the quality of insolvency proceedings, firms\' ability to obtain credit or the presence of barriers to entry.

Furthermore, financial institutions closer to the center of the network, which engage in transactions with additional financial institutions, tend to set lower haircut rates through more efficient matching of borrowing and lending needs for cash and securities. Thus, the credit quality of government bonds transacted, exchange rate stability, and the presence of intermediaries important to the trading network significantly impact the degree of market functioning.

Make-up strategies not only foster the alignment of inflation with target but also support productivity-improving investment in R&D and technology adoption and hence the long-run trend path, provided that the inherent make-up element is sufficiently pronounced. Inflation is less responsive to monetary policy due to the interaction with productivity dynamics.

Banks performing moderately have rather a small effect on both mean and variance process. Our findings are corroborated by the observed rank correlation between bank abnormal returns or equity volatility and stress test performance, which experiences a steady increase after each publication event.

The financial markets are highly integrated, and valuations of financial assets follow international patterns, which has contributed to large increases in financial wealth over the past 25 years. Nonetheless, this has not led to an equally large increase in property income because the rates of return have decreased during the same era. Moreover, changes in functional income distribution (capital/labour shares) have not been fully transmitted to the distribution of primary income between households because other institutional sectors \u2013 particularly the government sector \u2013 hold considerable amounts of financial assets. At least in the short term, the decrease in rates of return seems to contradict claims that, due to an increase in both financial and inherited wealth, we are entering an era of increasing income inequality. In this article, the link between financial wealth and pre-tax household income distribution is scrutinised for three European countries using a conceptually fully consistent macro framework. First, national balance sheets are combined with the related income flows. After this, income flows that are not property income but are considered part of national income (e.g., wages and salaries) are added, the national income flows are broken down by institutional sector and the household sector income flows separated. Finally, distributional household micro data are used to break down the aggregate household sector income flows by income decile. The article utilises this framework to analyse the evolution of rates of return and capital and labour shares as well as how the property income flows created by financial wealth have affected household primary income distribution.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2707~94a29f204d.en.pdf?4172cc058c4f858bb5dd3eb93a77c126","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"11 August 2022"},{"id":263,"date":"11 August 2022","day":11,"month":8,"year":2022,"title":"Monetary policy transmission in segmented markets","authors":"Jens Eisenschmidt, Yiming Ma, Anthony Lee Zhang","abstract":"We show that dealer market power impedes the pass-through of monetary policy in repo markets, which is an important first stage of monetary policy transmission.

In particular, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to infer the content (topics) of the articles, and Word Embedding (implemented with the Skip-gram model) and K-Means to measure their sentiment (uncertainty). In this way, we arrive at the definition of a set of daily topic-specific uncertainty indices. These indices are then used to find explanations for the behaviour of the US financial markets by implementing a batch of EGARCH models. In substance, we find that two topic-specific uncertainty indices, one related to COVID-19 news and the other to trade war news, explain the bulk of the movements in the financial markets from the beginning of 2019 to end-April 2020. Moreover, we find that the topic-specific uncertainty index related to the economy and the Federal Reserve is positively related to the financial markets, meaning that our index is able to capture actions of the Federal Reserve during periods of uncertainty.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2228e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"10 August 2022"},{"id":265,"date":"10 August 2022","day":10,"month":8,"year":2022,"title":"Does the European Central Bank speak differently when in parliament?","authors":"Nicol\xf2 Fraccaroli, Alessandro Giovannini, Jean-Francois Jamet, Eric Persson","abstract":"Parliamentary hearings are a fundamental tool to hold independent central banks accountable.

The source of preferred habitat demand is an insurance fund that issues annuities and adopts a liability-driven strategy to minimise the duration risk on its balance sheet. The optimising behaviour of the insurance fund implies a preferred-habitat demand function that is upward-sloping in bond prices and downward-sloping in bond yields, especially when interest rates are low. This supports the operation of a recruitment channel at low interest rates, whereby long-term interest rates react strongly to short-term policy rates because of complementary changes in term premia induced by preferred-habitat demand.

While a stronger no-bailout commitment reduces risk-shifting, it may not be optimal from the perspective of the creditor country, even ex-ante, if it increases the risk of immediate insolvency for high debt countries. Hence, the model provides a potential justification for the often decried policy of \'kicking the can down the road.\' Mapping the model to the estimated transfers, we find that the main purpose of the outsized Greek bailout was to prevent an exit from the eurozone and possible contagion.

Asset prices play a dual role of clearing markets and conveying agents\' private information, but markets are informationally inefficient: Agents can partially, but never fully, infer their counterparties\' private information from asset prices. The informational inefficiency of markets is more acute when liquidity conditions are especially tight or loose, as this impairs ability of prices to reveal private information about fundamentals. As a result, beliefs about fundamentals are shaped endogenously by cost shocks which are orthogonal to fundamentals, leading to socially costly booms and busts in asset prices. The equilibrium is constrained inefficient due to an information externality in which agents do not internalize how their choices affect the information set of other agents.

The estimates are conducted through two approaches, the hedonic approach and local projection, for the sampled sites that are selected from the viewpoint of avoiding potential omitted variable bias. Our main findings are threefold: (a) hazard map information affects land prices in a statistically significant manner. The effect is accompanied by a lag and its size varies depending on land use. (b) In addition to hazard map information, past flooding experiences affect land prices, suggesting the importance of the role played by the subjective flood risk perception formed through past flooding experiences. Indeed, in areas where large-scale flooding has occurred frequently in the past, hazard map information is reflected in the level of land prices to a greater degree and land prices are less susceptible to changes in hazard map information. (c) The estimated impact of flood risk on land prices based on the two approaches does not deviate significantly from the alternative measure of the impact of flood risk on land prices computed using the actual flood damage. However, the differences between the estimated impact and the alternative measure may become large for a certain type of flood risk and land use. Our results suggest that, in addition to the objective flood risk contained in, for example, hazard map, subjective perceptions of flood risk, such as those reflected in past flooding experiences, may also be important in land price formation.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e12.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 July 2022"},{"id":319,"date":"26 July 2022","day":26,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Developing reconciled quarterly distributional national wealth \u2013 insight into inequality and wealth structures","authors":"Janina Engel, Pau Gay\xe0 Riera, Joseph Grilli, Pierre Sola","abstract":"Distributional accounts for households enable measurement, study developments andidentify drivers of inequality.

Without PEPP, debt would be on an increasing (unsustainable) trajectory with high probability, while, with asset purchases, it is sustainable and the debt ratio is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by about 2030. The improvement in debt dynamics extends beyond the PEPP and is larger for more gradual unwinding of the Central Bank balance sheet. Optimal financing under PEPP induces an extension of maturities reducing the risk without increasing costs.

In the sudden stop, the central bank faces an intratemporal trade-off as output declines while inflation rises. In normal times, there is an intertemporal trade-off as the risk of a future sudden stop forces the central bank to factor financial stability considerations into its policy conduct.

Changes in the performance of a few large firms can arise due to idiosyncratic shocks or idiosyncratic reactions to common shocks. This paper provides direct evidence for the second channel using data on the universe of French firm-level exports and imports over 1993-2020. Granularity matters for the micro-dynamics of aggregate French exports over the long run: the granular residual explains 42% of the variance in aggregate export growth during the period. Moreover, it co-moves with the macro shocks: the largest firms do better than average in good times and worse in bad times. Studying firm-level performance during the Great Financial Crisis and the Pandemic reveals that top exporters contributed to the export collapses disproportionably more than their pre-crisis share of exports, even within finely defined markets. We investigate the reasons for such over-reaction of the top exporters using the Pandemic as a natural experiment. We find that a higher elasticity to demand shocks explains the larger reaction of top exporters to the Pandemic, with GVC exposure having weak explanatory power. Our findings have macro implications, as they help understand the macro reaction to foreign shocks, and micro implications, since they can inform micro models of exports.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/macro-micro-large-exporters-coping-common-shocks","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 July 2022"},{"id":334,"date":"14 July 2022","day":14,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Mis-allocation within firms: internal finance and international trade","authors":"Sebastian Doerr, Dalia Marin, Davide Suverato, Thierry Verdier","abstract":"This paper develops a novel theory of capital mis-allocation within firms that stems from managers\' empire building and informational frictions within the organization.

Under perfect competition in goods and factor markets, pass-through of corporate taxes should be zero, and their incidence mainly falls on factor prices.

By leveraging 1,058 changes in the local business tax rate between 2013 and 2017, we find that a one percentage point tax increase results in a 0.4% increase in the retail prices of goods produced by taxed _rms and purchased by consumers in the rest of Germany, who thus end up bearing a substantial share of the tax burden.

We also explore various dimensions of heterogeneity in pass-through related to market power, including producer size, market shares, and retail store types. While producer heterogeneity does not seem to matter, the significant passthrough of corporate taxes to consumer prices in the low inflation period covered by our sample is mostly due to price changes in supermarkets and hypermarkets.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2681~be66c3501e.en.pdf?562ac26a5c09069f6ba79a2ac0dcb419","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"13 July 2022"},{"id":337,"date":"13 July 2022","day":13,"month":7,"year":2022,"title":"Product quality, measured inflation and monetary policy","authors":"Alexander Rodnyansky, Alejandro Van der Ghote, Daniel Wales","abstract":"This paper proposes a tractable New Keynesian (NK) economy with endogenous adjustment in product quality that nests the canonical framework.

However, MC suffers from a slow convergence rate, which often results in a computational bottleneck and limits the usefulness of MC. Yet new developments in quantum computation may soon remove this bottleneck with the help of the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm, which speeds up the time taken by classical MC.\\nThis paper is the first to apply the QMC algorithm to problems in economics and among the first to apply quantum computation more generally to this field. We compare MC and QMC for typical economics problems and introduce economists to quantum computation. Our paper focuses on two such problems: (a) stress testing banks subject to credit shocks and fire sales and (b) solving a neoclassical dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with deep learning. In stress testing, we use QMC to estimate the expected system-wide capital loss of the banking system after a few periods of financial stress. In the deep learning solution of the neoclassical macroeconomic model, QMC estimates how a large economy behaves in the presence of random productivity shocks.\\nOur paper is written such that an economist without any knowledge of quantum computation can gradually progress to fully implementing the QMC algorithm for their problem of interest. In addition, the paper offers several improvements to the algorithm itself and supplies code for performing QMC and its benchmarking.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/6/staff-working-paper-2022-29","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 June 2022"},{"id":371,"date":"06/28/2022","day":28,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"Lost in Negative Territory?

In recent years, different interpretability techniques have appeared to assist in this task, although their usefulness is still a matter of debate. In this article we contribute to the debate by creating a framework to assess the accuracy of these interpretability techniques. We start from the generation of synthetic data sets, following an approach that allows us to control the importance of each explanatory variable (feature) in our target variable. By defining the importance of features ourselves, we can then calculate to what extent the explanations given by the interpretability techniques match the underlying truth. Therefore, if in our synthetic dataset we define a feature as relevant to the target variable, the interpretability technique should also identify it as a relevant feature. We run an empirical example in which we generate synthetic datasets intended to resemble underwriting and credit rating datasets, where the target variable is a binary variable representing applicant default. We then use non-interpretable ML models, such as deep learning, to predict default, and then explain their results using two popular interpretability techniques, SHAP and permutation Feature Importance (FI). Our results using the proposed framework suggest that SHAP is better at interpreting relevant features as such, although the results may vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the ML model used. We conclude that generating synthetic datasets shows potential as a useful approach for supervisors and practitioners looking for solutions to assess the interpretability tools available for ML models in the financial sector.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2222e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"23 June 2022"},{"id":378,"date":"22/06/2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"A quantification of the evolution of bilateral trade flows once bilateral RTAs are implemented","authors":"Blanca Jim\xe9nez-Garc\xeda and Julio Rodr\xedguez","abstract":"In this paper we study how 103 bilateral Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) shape bilateral trade flows over time. The analysis of quarterly trade flows from 1982 Q4 to 2018 Q4 shows dynamic differences between RTAs and among trading partners. Results show that countries benefit unevenly from bilateral RTAs. The positive global trade trend since the 1990s and the negative effect of the 2008 economic crisis are captured by a factor analysis that allows us to study specifically how trade agreements affect bilateral trade asymmetrically. On average, RTAs lead to a 10% increase in bilateral trade flows above the mean trend, but disparities are found since Partial Scope Agreements (PSAs) tend to boost bilateral trade more than Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) (21% compared to 9%). However, most of the effects of PSAs occur during the first four quarters after the agreements come into force, whereas FTAs have effects over a longer period. The current study uses cluster analysis to classify bilateral trade flows into homogeneous groups according to the dynamic impact that RTAs have on them. This allows the heterogeneity between clusters to be explored. Moreover, the results show a difference relating to the economic crisis starting in 2008: in general, the impact on bilateral trade of agreements in force before 2008 is positive (30%), while it is negative for agreements signed after 2008 (-9%). This indicates that RTAs play a heterogeneous role as a cycle smoothing mechanism. Finally, there is evidence of an anticipation effect: we find that for more than half of the bilateral trade flows studied, the effect of the bilateral RTA is detected before it comes into force.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2220e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"22 June 2022"},{"id":379,"date":"22 June 2022","day":22,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"The effects of local demand and supply restrictions on markup","authors":"Antonio Acconcia and Elisa Scarinzi","abstract":"We investigate the causal response of markup to a contraction in local demand and supply by comparing the response to these shocks across sectors characterized by different degrees of local competition.

A distressed firm exhibits both cash-flow and balance-sheet insolvency whereas a zombie firm is a distressed company that has received new credit. We carry out several analyses to test the validity of these definitions. For instance, we find that being distressed is negatively correlated with the probability of receiving new credit. However, the main bank of a distressed firm is more reluctant to restrict the supply of credit to such firm than a bank with no previous exposure to the company, which may reflect the incentives of the former to engage in loan evergreening. This financial support contributes to keeping zombie firms afloat for a longer period than distressed firms. Moreover, the contraction in capital, employment and sales is much larger in distressed firms than in zombie firms.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2219e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 June 2022"},{"id":389,"date":"17 June 2022","day":17,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"New facts on consumer price rigidity in the euro area","authors":"Erwan Gautier, Cristina Conflitti, Riemer P.

The result of the analysis is twofold. First, flood shocks dampen GDP from the supply side by reducing the capital stock inputs. The decline in GDP then impairs the balance sheets of firms and financial intermediaries, resulting in disruptions to financial intermediation and thus dampening GDP further from the demand side. Even when the direct damage due to floods is fully covered by insurance, the downward pressure on GDP endogenously deteriorates the balance sheets of these sectors, causing the same mechanism to operate. Second, the quantitative impacts of flood shocks on GDP up to now have been minor compared to the standard structural shocks that are considered important in existing macroeconomic studies, including shocks to total factor productivity (TFP) and the subjective discount factor. According to the estimates that use the relationship between the key variables in our model together with climate change scenarios published by an external organization, the impacts of these shocks could become somewhat larger in the future.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e05.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 June 2022"},{"id":406,"date":"June 3, 2022","day":3,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"How Do Floods Affect the Economy? An Empirical Analysis using Japanese Flood Data","authors":"Takuro Ashizawa, Nao Sudo, Hiroki Yamamoto","abstract":"The impact of natural disasters caused by increasing-scale climate change on economic activity has been the focus of global attention in recent years. Natural disasters primarily damage the assets owned by firms and households and public infrastructure, i.e., direct effects, but they may also affect the economic activity through the subsequent changes in production inputs, i.e., indirect effects. While there is already a large number of empirical analysis on the indirect effects, however, no consensus has been established not only on the scale and persistence, but even on the signs. In this paper, we estimate the indirect effects of past flood disasters in Japan on the real economy using Prefectural Accounts and Flood Statistics. There are three main findings. First, while floods have a negative effect on the GDP of the prefecture in which they occur, this effect may not persist over the long run as it loses statistical significance after the year following the year of occurrence. Second, floods have different effects across sectors. Floods generally have a negative effect on GDP of the manufacturing and the wholesale and retail sectors, while they tend to have a positive effect on GDP of the construction sector. Third, the magnitude of the indirect effect of floods differs for asset, facility, and equipment that incurs damage. Compared to damage to the assets owned by firms and households, damage to public infrastructure, such as roads, and to public service utilities, such as electric power facilities, tend to depress GDP more significantly, which may indicate the importance of public assets in the spillover effects of flood damage.","linkarticle":"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2022/wp22e06.htm","centralbank":"Bank of Japan","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"3 June 2022"},{"id":407,"date":"06/02/2022","day":2,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"State-dependent Central Bank Communication with Heterogeneous Beliefs","authors":"By Herbert Sylv\xe9rie","abstract":"This paper studies how state-contingent central bank communication can improve welfare when externalities are at play. In the model, a central banker (CB) wants to influence the private sector beliefs, which are heterogeneous, to generate an upward bias in their action. The CB can engender such welfare-improving bias by providing public information, choosing a signalling strategy that is a function of fundamentals. To study this optimal communication strategy, I introduce heterogeneous priors in an otherwise standard Bayesian persuasion model \xe0 la Gentzkow and Kamenica (2011) and characterize the dependence of optimal disclosure on the heterogeneity of beliefs. I show that heterogeneity matters in two ways: (i) it is optimal to send moderating signals, which implies sending signals with positive error probabilities in both states, and constitutes a non-trivial departure from the homogeneous beliefs case; (ii) higher dispersion in beliefs leads the monetary authority to send signals with lower error probabilities. I apply my framework to a central bank communication problem in which the policy maker communicates about aggregate conditions to influence firms\' investment decisions in presence of investment externalities. I empirically validate the model\'s predictions by showing that the FOMC unemployment rate forecasts are systematically biased in opposite directions in recessions and expansions. Also in line with the model\'s predictions, the forecast biases are decreasing in the degree of private sector disagreement for each state.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/state-dependent-central-bank-communication-heterogeneous-beliefs","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 June 2022"},{"id":408,"date":"1 June 2022","day":1,"month":6,"year":2022,"title":"Temporal networks in the analysis of financial contagion","authors":"Fabio Franch, Luca Nocciola, Angelos Vouldis","abstract":"This paper studies the dynamics of contagion across the banking, insurance and shadow banking sectors of 16 advanced economies in the period 2006-2018.

This boost in vaccination rates, in turn, translates into a significant increase in retail spending, which is larger and somewhat more persistent than what we document in our state-level panel regressions.

This paper asks how the burden of childcare affects the labor market integration of immigrants. To identify the contribution of this burden to the native-immigrant employment gap, it exploits European Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) microdata from 2004 to 2019. This survey collects information on respondents\u2019 counterfactual behaviour, in the event that: a) they had no care responsibilities; b) they could find a job compatible with their care responsibilities; c) they had access to childcare services. This information allows estimates to be obtained of the impact of childcare on labor supply comparable across eleven countries. Our results show that the burden of childcare is the major obstacle to the integration of immigrant mothers. While the employment gap between non-EU immigrant and native mothers in Northern and Southern Europe is 35 and 17 percentage points (pp) respectively, two-thirds (24 pp and 12 pp) of it is explained by childcare motivated inactivity. We reject the hypothesis that the childcare gap is solely driven by immigrants\u2019 sociodemographic traits or traditional parenting norms. Our estimates suggest that at least a quarter (5.8 pp and 2.6 pp) of the gap is due to the higher opportunity cost of paid work faced by immigrant mothers; that equal access to childcare could reduce it by 10 pp and 7 pp; and that immigrants\u2019 exclusion from flexible time arrangements could explain the larger size and higher persistence of the gap in the North. This paper contributes to the literature on immigrant integration, highlighting that the child penalty is the main obstacle to female migrant labor supply and that differences in how European societies handle the burden of care can account for their records on the integration of immigrant households, suggesting that family policies could be central to the integration policy mix and even influence the migration decision.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2216e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"31 May 2022"},{"id":424,"date":"31 May 2022","day":31,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"One scheme fits all: a central fiscal capacity for the EMU targeting eurozone, national and regional shocks","authors":"Roel Beetsma, Jacopo Cimadomo, Josha van Spronsen","abstract":"This paper proposes a central fiscal capacity for the euro area that generates transfers in response to eurozone, country, and region-specific shocks.

This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We build on one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle (Woodford\u2019s finite planning horizons) by amending the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting.

We first propose a novel methodology to estimate bank market power at the local level. We design a data-intensive local version of the Lerner index by developing heuristics to allocate national-level banks\' inputs, products, and costs across their branches using large-scale datasets from many sources. We then exploit the exogenous variation in COVID-19 intensity across Brazilian localities to analyze how the pandemic influenced local market power through the effective price and marginal cost channels. Despite reducing the economic activity, COVID-19 did not impact the effective price channel: bank branches offset the decrease in credit income by reducing credit concessions. However, bank branches more affected by COVID-19 experienced increased marginal costs as they could not rapidly adjust their cost factors in response to the decrease in credit concessions. Consequently, COVID-19 reduced banks\' local market power via the marginal cost channel. More digitalized bank branches enjoy cost and lending flexibility: they experience less stickiness in their cost structure and complement the reduced credit concessions in localities more affected by COVID-19 by extending credit to borrowers in remote localities less affected. Consequently, more digitalized banks improve their market power compared to traditional banks.

Accommodative monetary policies such as forward guidance result in large increases in inflation but have only limited effects on real economic activity as long as the risk of infection is large. The optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is conducted optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target.

However, an unconventional credit policy, that consists on central bank liquidity injection to banks provided they commit to issue loans (indirect central bank loans) that are guaranteed by the government, can undo partially the effects of the credit frictions and prevents the economy from reaching the ZLB. Since indirect central bank (CB) loans cannot be diverted by banks and are governmentguaranteed, credit market interventions rise aggregate credit supply and positively affect the aggregate credit demand, respectively. However, once the economy is at the ZLB the effect of a credit policy is reduced due to a relatively stronger inflation reduction, which in turn reduces entrepreneurs\' incentives to demand bank loans, and due to that the relative cost reduction from having access to cheaper indirect CB loans is smaller.","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work1019.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 May 2022"},{"id":431,"date":"05/25/2022","day":25,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Natural Disasters and Financial Stress: Can Macroprudential Regulation Tame Green Swans?

Faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-border payment services will deliver widespread benefits for citizens and economies worldwide, supporting economic growth, international trade, global development, and financial inclusion. Enhancing cross-border payments requires more than mere adoption of technical standards. The best outcome involves aligned technological, regulatory, and legal frameworks. This paper analyzes such payment integration projects.\\nEach border adds to the costs of a cross-border payment if crossing the border means entering into a different technological, regulatory and legal environment, with different systems, regulators, and courts. Under ideal circumstances, cross-border payments will be processed as seamlessly as comparable domestic payments, even where various currencies are processed. While this highly ambitious target is unlikely to be achieved globally in the short to medium term, regionally, the gap between cross-border and domestic payments has already been narrowed. At the global level, mismatches between the inter-institutional framework on the back-end and the contractual relationship with clients on the front-end represent potential costs for the payment services provider and increase legal risk, prompting costly legal, due diligence manual adjustments in payments processes. A high degree of cross-border harmonization via rulebooks along the technological, regulatory, and legal dimensions has been instrumental for successful regional integration projects and has promoted straight-through-processing.

The heterogeneous nature of this model enables us to assess the effects of such experiments on the housing, rental and mortgage markets not only in the aggregate, but also at the level of individual households and sub-segments, such as first-time buyers, homeowners, buy-to-let investors, and renters. This approach can therefore offer a broad picture of the disaggregated effects of financial stability policies. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, including data from a leading UK real estate online search engine as well as loan-level regulatory data. With a series of comparative statics exercises, we investigate the impact of: i) a hard loan-to-value limit, and ii) a soft loan-to-income limit, allowing for a limited share of unconstrained new mortgages. We find that, first, these experiments tend to mitigate the house price cycle by reducing credit availability and therefore leverage. Second, an experiment targeting a specific risk measure may also affect other risk metrics, thus necessitating a careful calibration of the policy to achieve a given reduction in risk. Third, experiments targeting the owner-occupier housing market can spill over to the rental sector, as a compositional shift in home ownership from owner-occupiers to buy-to-let investors affects both the supply of and demand for rental properties.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2217e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 May 2022"},{"id":444,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"DISPERSION OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE: PASSTHROUGH, PRODUCTIVITY, AND DEMAND","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-414-dispersion-over-the-business-cycle-passthrough-productivity-and-demand.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":445,"date":"16/05/2022","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Trading volume and liquidity provision in cryptocurreny markets","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2022/no.-413-trading-volume-and-liquidity-provision-in-cryptocurreny-markets.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":446,"date":"2022-05-16","day":16,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Transmission of Cyber Risk Through the Canadian Wholesale Payment System","authors":"Kosse, Anneke, Lu, Zhentong","abstract":"In response to growing concerns about cyber and other operational risks\u2014such as those related to climate change\u2014international organizations, central banks and private sector entities have taken collaborative actions to increase the operational and data resilience of financial institutions and financial market infrastructures, including payment systems. In Canada, the Bank of Canada has established and leads the Canadian Financial Sector Resiliency Group and the Resilience of Wholesale Payments Systems (RWPS) initiative, which both offer a forum for coordinating a national sectoral response to systemic operational incidents, such as cyber attacks (see Dinis 2021 for details).\xa0\\nAs part of the RWPS initiative, this paper studies how the impact of a cyber attack that paralyzes one or multiple banks\' ability to send payments would transmit to other banks through the Canadian wholesale payment system.

We find that depending on the type and number of banks under attack, the time of the attack and the design of the payment system, a cyber attack can quickly become systemic and result in a significant loss of liquidity throughout the system. We also demonstrate that the system-wide impact of an attack can be significantly reduced by having contingency plans that enable attacked banks to continue to send high-value payments. Given the interconnectedness of banks, we conclude that the cyber resilience of a wholesale payment system depends strongly on the cyber resilience of its participants, and we underline the importance of strong sectoral collaboration and coordination.\xa0","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/5/staff-working-paper-2022-23","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"16 May 2022"},{"id":447,"date":"13 May 2022","day":13,"month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The digital economy, privacy, and CBDC","authors":"Toni Ahnert, Peter Hoffmann, Cyril Monnet","abstract":"We study a model of financial intermediation, payment choice, and privacy in the digital economy.

These differences create asymmetric (directional) linkages with the rest of the banking system that matter for individual bank stability. We capture this directionality by consistently comparing the flows of risk in the bank-to-system and system-to-bank direction. We find that banks with a stronger system-to-bank connection had a higher default risk during the global financial crisis (2008\u201309), and that the mechanism behind increased default risk runs through trading and asset risk, increasing the volatility of profits.\\nOur findings offer two important policy implications. Firstly, linkages in the financial system can be directional, and regulation should concentrate on imposing buffers on banks with positive net exposures, rather than just on large banks. Secondly, current bank supervision objectives can be achieved more efficiently if regulation focuses on preventing such net exposures, rather than buffering the default risks arising from them.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/5/staff-working-paper-2022-19","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"2 May 2022"},{"id":465,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"The Wealth Distribution and Redistributive Preferences: Evidence from a Randomized Survey Experiment","authors":"Nicol\xe1s Albacete, Pirmin Fessler, Peter Lindner","abstract":"The abstract couldn\'t be scraped easily from the website.","linkarticle":"https://www.oenb.at/dam/jcr:f551a3bf-cd08-4212-8cb2-9fd059342401/WP239.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Austria","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":466,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Monetary Policy and Homeownership: Empirical Evidence, Theory, and Policy Implications","authors":"Daniel A.

Stagnation is the result of a shortage of assets that creates an oversupply of savings and puts downward pressure on the level of interest rates. Once the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate binds, the real rate cannot fully adjust downward, forcing output to fall instead. In such context, bubbles are useful as they expand the supply of assets, absorb excess savings and raise the natural interest rate - the real rate that is compatible with full employment - crowding in consumption and raising welfare. While safe bubbles are more likely to expand economic activity, riskier bubbles command a risk premium that, in equilibrium, lowers the real interest rate. A lower rate loosens borrowing constraints, potentially improving welfare when financing conditions are especially tight. Finally, fiscal policy that promises a bail-out transfer in case of a bubble collapse can support an existing bubble and improve welfare.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/bubbles-and-stagnation.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":469,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"Retail CBDC and U.S. Monetary Policy Implementation: A Stylized Balance Sheet Analysis","authors":"Matthew Malloy, Francis Martinez, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Alex Thorp","abstract":"This paper discusses how a Federal Reserve issued retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) could affect U.S. monetary policy implementation.

We develop what we call the \\"Kaleckian Phillips curve\\", the slope of which is determined by the bargaining power of trade unions. We show that a nearly 90 percent reduction in inflation volatility is possible even without any changes in monetary policy when the economy transitions from equal shares of power between workers and firms to a new balance in which firms dominate.

Such a tax reform leads to expansionary long-run aggregate output and investment effects, but those are coupled with increases in wage, consumption, and income inequality. The tax reform is not self-financing and its effects depend crucially on whether the government cuts lump-sum transfers or raises distortionary labor or consumption tax rates for financing. The former results in a larger aggregate expansion, but at the expense of a greater rise in inequality. As a result, the latter is relatively more beneficial for unskilled households. We find that the tax reform, when the consumption tax rate adjusts, leads to a Pareto improvement in terms of life-time welfare. For transition dynamics, monetary policy, in addition to the fiscal adjustments, matters. In particular, if monetary policy inflates away a portion of the public debt, the economy can avoid the short-run contraction that would arise otherwise.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/macroeconomic-effects-of-capital-tax-rate-changes.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" May 2022"},{"id":475,"date":"May 2022","day":"  ","month":5,"year":2022,"title":"A Parsimonious Model of Idiosyncratic Income","authors":"Edmund Crawley, Martin Blomhoff Holm, H\xe5kon Tretvoll","abstract":"The standard model of permanent and transitory income is known to be misspecified.

Bitcoin has emerged as the most popular among them, with a total valuation that reached an all-time high of $68,000 in November 2021. However, its price has historically been subject to large and abrupt fluctuations, as the sudden drop in the months that followed once again proved. Since bitcoin looks all set to continue growing while largely concentrating its activity in unregulated environments, concerns have been raised among authorities all over the world about its potential impact on financial stability, monetary policy, and the integrity of the financial system. As a result, building a sound and proper regulatory and supervisory framework to address these challenges hinges upon achieving a better understanding of both the critical underlying factors that influence the formation of bitcoin prices and the stability of such factors over time. In this article we analyse which variables determine the price at which bitcoin is traded on the most relevant exchanges. To this end, we use a flexible machine learning model, specifically a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, to establish the price of bitcoin as a function of a number of economic, technological and investor attention variables. Our LSTM model replicates reasonably well the behaviour of the price of bitcoin over different periods of time. We then use an interpretability technique known as SHAP to understand which features most influence the LSTM outcome. We conclude that the importance of the different variables in bitcoin price formation changes substantially over the period analysed. Moreover, we find that not only does their influence vary, but also that new explanatory factors often seem to appear over time that, at least for the most part, were initially unknown.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2215e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 April 2022"},{"id":482,"date":"11.04.2022","day":11,"month":4,"year":2022,"title":"Addressing COVID-19 outliers in BVARs with stochastic volatility","authors":"Andrea Carriero, Todd E.

We classify these occupations according to whether they are in the area of digital infrastructure, whether they can be performed remotely and whether they are at risk of automation. We then study how changes in pandemic containment policies that vary by province affect these groups of job postings.\\nWe find that job postings for occupations related to digital infrastructure and that allow for remote work decline less during lockdowns and rebound quicker during reopenings than postings for more traditional occupations.

The typical view is that currency depreciation leads to higher exports because it lowers export prices and entices foreign buyers to switch spending toward these goods. But why the exchange rate depreciates in the first place might also matter. In this article, we shed light on this aspect of the issue.\\nWe ask whether the relationship between exchange rate movements and exports differs depending on the fundamental driver of the exchange rate. Using data for Canada, we identify cases where the Canada-US exchange rate changes because of factors such as Canadian monetary policy, global oil prices and US income growth. From there, we account for how exports evolve in each of these cases.\xa0\\nWe find that exports evolve very differently from one shock to another. This, we argue, reflects that the direct impact of the exchange rate on export prices and export purchases is weak. Instead, the main driver of exports for Canada is not the exchange rate but rather US growth, which sometimes comoves with the exchange rate. Our findings suggest that the exchange rate\u2019s role as an automatic stabilizer and in transmitting monetary policy for Canada is not as strong as is traditionally assumed.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/4/staff-working-paper-2022-18","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 April 2022"},{"id":489,"date":"04/04/2022","day":4,"month":4,"year":2022,"title":"The Currency Channel of the Global Bank Leverage Cycle","authors":"By Pedrono Justine","abstract":"The amplitude of leverage procyclicality is heterogeneous across banks and across countries.

By altering the distribution of global bank portfolio, international diversification adds a currency channel to the risk channel of the global leverage cycle. Using granular data on banks located in France, the paper shows that the pre-crisis international diversification of banks increased leverage procyclicality during the 2008-2009 crisis. Focusing on the currency channel, namely the valuation effect of currency diversification, results show that it had a negative effect on leverage procyclicality during this period, hence decreasing procyclicality. The currency channel contributed to offset part of the increased risk due to the crisis and the risk channel.

The model has a representation similar to the two-equation NK model, with an additional condition linking productivity growth to current and expected future output gaps. Absent state contingency in the subsidies that correct the externalities associated with productivity growth, optimal monetary policy sets inflation above target whenever the subsidies fall short of the externalities. In the recovery from a spell at the ZLB, the optimal discretionary policy sets inflation temporarily above target, helping mitigate the long-run damage. Following a cost-push shock that creates inflationary pressure, the central bank tolerates a larger rise in inflation than in a model with exogenous productivity. The gains from commitment include the central bank\'s ability to make credible promises about future output gaps in a way that allows it to manipulate current productivity growth.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/monetary-policy-in-a-model-of-growth.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" April 2022"},{"id":493,"date":"April 2022","day":"  ","month":4,"year":2022,"title":"Reusing Natural Experiments","authors":"Davidson Heath, Matthew C.

TALF was an unusual crisis facility because it provided loans to a wide range of nonbank financial institutions. Using detailed loan-level data unexplored by previous researchers, we study the behavior of nonbank borrowers in TALF. We find the extent to which the actions of these borrowers supported key program goals--stabilizing markets quickly, winding down the program when it was no longer needed, providing liquidity to a wide range of assets, and having borrowers internalize credit risk rather than shift it to the government--were related to institutional differences across nonbanks. Since all TALF borrowers faced the same program terms and conditions, our study is able to highlight the role of these institutional constraints.","linkarticle":"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/crisis-liquidity-facilities-with-nonbank-counterparties.htm","centralbank":"Federal Reserve","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":" April 2022"},{"id":495,"date":"April 2022","day":"  ","month":4,"year":2022,"title":"The Importance of Technology in Banking during a Crisis","authors":"Nicola Pierri and Yannick Timmer","abstract":"What are the implications of information technology (IT) in banking for financial stability?

First, since the previous version of the model, the underlying nomenclature used at the European level (ECOICOP) to define some of the main aggregates was changed, therefore requiring a careful review of the relevance of initial equations. Second, in the context of the modification in 2019 of the main semi-structural macroeconomic model used for the macroeconomic projections at Banque de France (FR-BDF), it aims at harmonizing the iterations between MAPI and FR-BDF. Finally, large variations in the wage variables in the midst of the sanitary measures related to the Covid-19 pandemics pushed us to use different concepts of wage and compensation variables. At the crossroads of these considerations, we update the model extending the estimation window, correcting specifications and input variables whenever relevant. The resulting model is an up-to-date, simplified and more parsimonious version of the initial model, entailing a stronger harmonization with the central macroeconomic model FR-BDF.

As banks put more weight on mark-to-market gains, they find it optimal to refrain from revealing information about adverse shocks. Consequently, default risk is mispriced, and loan volumes, and thus investment, are not appropriately reduced. Overinvestment lowers the price of capital, leading households to increase consumption without decreasing labour supply, generating a boom. Due to mispricing, banks subsequently face bigger losses and capital depletion. Output then decreases sharply due to credit supply shortages. In a model calibrated to the US economy, these instances of market dysfunction are crucial in amplifying credit cycles.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2214e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 March 2022"},{"id":499,"date":"28/03/2022","day":28,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"The propagation of worldwide sector-specific shocks","authors":"Mario Izquierdo, Enrique Moral-Benito, Elvira Prades and Javier Quintana","abstract":"This paper analyses the aggregate impact of industry-specific shocks and their propagation through global production networks.

For that purpose, we highlight the importance of departing from standard linear models that assume unitary elasticities of substitution. We combine a theoretical framework of production networks with arbitrary elasticities of substitution (Baqaee & Farhi, 2019) and we make use of World Input-Output Database to account for international linkages. This setting illustrates how, in the presence of production input complementarities, the interaction between simultaneous shocks has significant non-linear effects on sectoral composition and aggregate output. The aggregate impact of negative (positive) shocks gets significantly amplified (mitigated) when they affect simultaneously industries with strong production linkages. Our results show that ignoring production complementarities leads to vastly underestimating the aggregate consequences of regulatory or technological shocks in industries like chemicals or vehicle manufacturing. In contrast, simultaneous shocks to services industries are well accounted for by standard measures.","linkarticle":"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/DocumentosTrabajo/22/Files/dt2213e.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Spain","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 March 2022"},{"id":500,"date":"28.03.2022","day":28,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Optimal timing of policy interventions in troubled banks","authors":"Philipp J.

We find that non-linear contagion leads to substantially larger losses than its linear counterpart for a wide range of intermediate levels of stress in the system, while its effects become negligible for very low and very high stress levels. Regarding uncertainty, we find that its effects, while smaller than those of non-linear contagion, are nonetheless relevant and most important around levels of stress at which different parts of the system become unstable. Interestingly, losses can be amplified or mitigated with respect to the deterministic case depending on the specific level of stress considered.

First, we investigate the characteristics of the various categories underlying ESG scores. Not all types of ESG categories lend themselves to more targeted strategies, which is related to both limits to ESG data disclosure and the fundamental challenge of translating qualitative characteristics into quantitative measures. Second, we consider an investment scheme based on the exclusion of firms with the lowest scores in each category of interest. In most cases, this targeted strategy still allows investors to substantially improve the portfolio headline ESG score, with only a marginal impact on financial performance relative to a broad stock market benchmark. The exclusion results in regional and sectoral biases relative to the benchmark, which may be undesirable for some investors. We then implement a \\"best-in-class\\" strategy, based on excluding firms with the lowest category scores and reinvesting the proceeds in firms with the highest scores maintaining the same regional and sectoral composition.

Welfare gains associated with countercyclical capital buffers are calculated for three policy regimes: independent policies (Nash), coordination, and reciprocity---a regime in which capital ratios set in the core are imposed on branches operating in the periphery.

On the other hand, inequality has been rising in major developed economies since the 1980s.

They use the application to read news or posts from friends. At the same time, the social media app learns about the consumer by analyzing their profile and monitoring their browsing habits. The more actively the consumer uses the service, the more data the app can collect, which often means a better experience for the consumer and higher revenue for the service.\\nThe consumer faces a trade-off: On the one hand, they enjoy the benefits of using social media, such as socializing with friends. On the other hand, the consumer also values their privacy and is concerned about the risk of data leakage, identity theft or other potential abuses of personal information. If the consumer thinks the privacy cost of using the app is high, they will reduce their activity on the platform.\\nThis paper develops a dynamic game-theoretic model that analyzes the interaction between a consumer\u2019s incentive to protect privacy and a platform\u2019s incentive to collect data. The platform can encourage the consumer to use the service more actively by employing a certain privacy policy. The key idea is that when the consumer has low privacy on a platform, the marginal cost to the consumer of giving up more privacy is low. Thus, data collection reduces the consumer\'s welfare but increases their incentive to keep using the service.\\nThe paper shows that the platform can collect a lot of data even if the consumer is sensitive to privacy. To do so, the platform initially offers high privacy protection to encourage the consumer to use the platform; however, as time goes by, the platform gradually degrades privacy protection. In the long run, the consumer will lose privacy but keep a high activity level, and the platform typically offers negligible privacy protection.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/3/staff-working-paper-2022-8","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 March 2022"},{"id":528,"date":"2022-03-04","day":4,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Central Bank Liquidity Facilities and Market Making","authors":"Cimon, David, Walton, Adrian","abstract":"In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 led to turmoil in financial markets around the world.

This tension creates the risk of a shift away from the conventional arrangement to one in which monetary policy becomes mostly subordinate to fiscal policy decisions. We study how this risk affects the design of monetary policy. We use a model with both a monetary and a fiscal authority that interact non-cooperatively and have different degrees of commitment.\\nSpecifically, we examine whether a central bank should design a monetary policy framework that prescribes acting conditionally on how fiscal policy behaves. We find that such a framework not only improves economic outcomes by providing appropriate incentives to the fiscal authority but also may enhance the central bank\u2019s credibility.","linkarticle":"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/3/staff-working-paper-2022-11","centralbank":"Bank of Canada","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"4 March 2022"},{"id":531,"date":"03/03/2022","day":3,"month":3,"year":2022,"title":"Dual returns to experience","authors":"Jose Garcia-Louzao, Laura Hospido and Alessandro Ruggieri","abstract":"This paper studies how labor market duality affects human capital accumulation and the wage trajectories of young workers in Spain.

Incentives arise from the positive response of investors to returns achieved through cyclical risk-taking and non-linearities in the relationship between fund returns and fund flows, which may keep managers from fully internalising the effects of adverse outcomes on their portfolios.

Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find that the manufacturing wage premium\u2014the additional pay a manufacturing worker earns relative to a comparable nonmanufacturing worker\u2014disappeared in recent years and that the erosion of the premium has primarily affected workers employed in production occupations, who experienced a wage decline of 2.5 percentage points since the 1990s relative to other workers in production occupations. While the demographic composition and other worker observables introduce level differences in manufacturing premia, our analysis suggests that they are not responsible for the declining trends. A decomposition of the premium by union membership status reveals that declines have been substantially larger across union members. To quantify the role of unionization membership on wage premia, we exploit the heterogeneity in membership status across industries within manufacturing. We find that the decline in union membership explains more than 70 percent of the decline in premia since the 1990s for union members, but the declines in unionization rates have not significantly affected non-union premia, which have instead responded to other factors, such as capital intensity.

An informational feedback loop emerges when each side underestimates the effect of its own action on the other\'s inference, possibly leading to large and persistent changes in perceived r-star disconnected from fundamentals.

The model matches remarkably well the short and long run dynamics of skilled and unskilled workers. Skill mismatch and skill-specific labour market institutions have three main effects on business cycles and growth dynamics. First, as the composition of labour market skills leads to supply segmentation, the relative scarcity of skilled workers increases the natural rate of unemployment and reduces total factor productivity with long-run effects on the growth rate of output. Second, skill heterogeneity in the labour market generates asymmetric outcomes and ampli.es measures of employment, wages and consumption inequality. Finally, the model provides important insights for the Phillips and Beveridge curves.

A by-product of our analysis is a structural interpretation of two-way fixed effects regressions in loan-level data: according to our framework, firm- and bank-time fixed effects only separate demand from supply under certain parametric assumptions. In the data, the conditions are satisfied for supply but not for demand: bank-time fixed effects identify true supply shocks up to a time constant, while firm-time fixed effects are contaminated by supply forces. Our methodology overcomes this limitation: we identify supply and demand shocks at the aggregate and individual levels.","linkarticle":"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2646~5ebd30e172.en.pdf?51f45d72baa0ab7c510d5d7cc7359b6e","centralbank":"European Central Bank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"17 February 2022"},{"id":562,"date":"17 February 2022","day":17,"month":2,"year":2022,"title":"Liquidation value and loan pricing","authors":"Francesca Barbiero, Glenn Schepens, Jean-David Sigaux","abstract":"We show that the liquidation value of collateral depends on who is pledging it.

Consistent with a strengthened collateral lending channel, entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise. In line with the model\'s implications, higher startup activity does not diminish startup quality. Instrumental variable regressions at the bank level further show that IT makes banks\' credit supply more responsive to changes in local house prices, and weakens the importance of geographical distance between borrowers and lenders.

To that end, we develop a novel general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous banks, interbank markets for both secured and unsecured credit, and a central bank. The model features a number of occasionally binding constraints. The interactions between these constraints - in particular leverage and liquidity constraints - are key in determining macroeconomic outcomes. We find that both secured and unsecured money market frictions force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to de-lever, which leads to less lending and output. If the liquidity constraint is very tight, the leverage constraint may turn slack. In this case, there are large declines in lending and output.

The ensuing macroeconomic downturn is amplified by a strong reduction of consumption among poorer households in response to rising borrowing costs and falling labor income.

This only evaluates make-up strategies when financial markets do not notice them, or deem them non-credible. We amend one leading solution to the forward-guidance puzzle -namely Woodford\'s finite planning horizons -to the assumption that financial markets have rational expectations on policy rates, and incorporate them into the long-term nominal interest rates faced by all. Agents still have a limited ability to foresee the consequences of monetary policy on output and inflation, making the model still immune to the forward-guidance puzzle. First, we find that make-up strategies that compensate for a past deficit of accommodation after an ELB episode have sizably better stabilization properties than inflation targeting.

Furthermore, we document that underestimations of banks\' credit risk by markets were associated with lower funding costs and higher wholesale borrowing (for all banks) as well as with greater risk taking and higher profitability (for European periphery banks).","linkarticle":"https://www.bis.org/publ/work992.htm","centralbank":"Bank of International Settlements","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 January 2022"},{"id":615,"date":"01/19/2022","day":19,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"How do Gasoline Prices Respond to a Cost Shock ?","authors":"By Gautier Erwan, Marx Magali, Vertier Paul","abstract":"Using several millions of daily prices collected over the period 2007-2018 in France, we investigate how gasoline retail prices respond to a common shock on marginal cost (i.e. the wholesale gasoline price quoted on the Rotterdam market). We find that the pass-through is complete: a 1% change in Rotterdam price translates to a change in retail price of 0.8%, in line with the share of the wholesale gasoline in total costs. The adjustment is gradual: the full pass through takes about 3 weeks. In a broad class of sticky price models, the ratio of the kurtosis over the frequency of price changes is shown to be a sufficient statistic for the cumulative impulse response of prices (CIRP) to a nominal shock. We provide evidence that the sufficient statistic prediction holds when we look at how gasoline prices respond to a common cost shock. Relating, at the gas station level, the CIRP to moments of the price change distribution, we find that the CIRP correlates with the ratio of kurtosis over frequency, but also with both frequency and kurtosis taken separately. The sign and the magnitude of the correlations are fully in line with theoretical predictions. We also show that other moments do not correlate with CIRP as robustly as the frequency and the kurtosis.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/how-do-gasoline-prices-respond-cost-shock","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 January 2022"},{"id":616,"date":"18 January 2022","day":18,"month":1,"year":2022,"title":"Monetary policy and endogenous financial crises","authors":"Frederic Boissay, Fabrice Collard, Jordi Gal\xed, Cristina Manea","abstract":"We study whether a central bank should deviate from its objective of price stability to promote financial stability.

First, monetary policy affects the probability of a crisis both in the short run (through aggregate demand) and in the medium run (through savings and capital accumulation). Second, a central bank can both reduce the probability of a crisis and increase welfare by departing from strict inflation targeting and responding systematically to fluctuations in output.

Among the various scenarios, a two-tiered banking system can both support stablecoin issuance and maintain traditional forms of credit creation. In contrast, a narrow bank approach for digital currencies can lead to disintermediation of traditional banking, but may provide the most stable peg to fiat currencies.

Most widespread are point targets, target ranges, hybrid combinations of the two, or mere definitions of price stability. This paper proposes a novel empirical measure of expectations anchoring based on the cross-sectional distribution of private sector inflation point forecasts. Applying this to a panel of 29 countries, it finds three main results. First, a numerical target definition per se does not improve anchoring compared to a definition of price stability, while the formulation of a numerical reference point increases the degree of anchoring. Second, point targets and hybrid target formulations are associated with better anchoring than target ranges. Third, periods of persistent target deviations lead to an increase in tail risks to the inflation outlook. Conditional on such periods, point targets and hybrid targets attenuate tail risks to the inflation outlook, with a stronger quantitative effect for point targets. The results are consistent with models suggesting that targets ranges are interpreted as zones where monetary policy is less active.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/anchoring-inflation-expectations-do-inflation-target-formulations-matter","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"9 December 2021"},{"id":650,"date":"12/08/2021","day":8,"month":12,"year":2021,"title":"Corporate Liquidity During the Covid-19 Crisis: the Trade Credit Channel","authors":"By Bureau Benjamin, Duquerroy Anne, Vinas Fr\xe9d\xe9ric","abstract":"Using unique daily data on payment defaults to suppliers in France, we show how the trade credit channel amplified the Covid-19 shock, during the first months of the pandemic.

We first show how such data must be adjusted for meteorological patterns which can alter data quality and pollutant emissions. We use machine learning techniques to better account for non-linearities and interactions between variables. We then find evidence that nowcasting performances for monthly industrial production are significantly improved when relying on daily NO2 data compared to benchmark models based on PMIs and auto-regressive (AR) terms.

The presence of the ZLB prevents the central bank from offsetting negative shocks to inflation whereas it can offset positive shocks. This asymmetry pushes average inflation below the target which in turn drags down inflation expectations and reinforces the likelihood of hitting the ZLB. We show that this deflationary bias is particularly relevant for a Central Bank with a symmetric dual mandate (i.e. minimizing deviations from inflation and employment), especially when facing demand shocks. But a strict inflation targeter cannot escape the sub-optimal deflationary equilibrium either. The deflationary bias can be mitigated by targeting \u201cshortfalls\u201d instead of \u201cdeviations\u201d from maximum employment and/or using flexible average inflation targeting. However, changing monetary policy strategy risks inflation expectations becoming entrenched above the target if the natural interest rate increases.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/deflationary-bias-zlb-and-feds-strategic-response","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"28 October 2021"},{"id":671,"date":"26.10.2021","day":26,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Hitting the elusive inflation target","authors":"Francesco Bianchi, Leonardo Melosi, Matthias Rottner","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/878942/934c9e3b95cb666df0c1616b94dfb99c/mL/2021-10-26-dkp-40-data.pdf","centralbank":"Bundesbank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"26 October 2021"},{"id":672,"date":"25.10.2021","day":25,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Safe asset shortage and collateral reuse","authors":"Stephan Jank, Emanuel Moench, Michael Schneider","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/878798/19740febf3ca527df453194d8540d92e/mL/2021-10-25-dkp-39-data.pdf","centralbank":"Bundesbank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"25 October 2021"},{"id":673,"date":"10/25/2021","day":25,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Financial flows, macro-prudential policies, capital restrictions and institutions: what do gravity equations tell us?","authors":"By Bricongne Jean-Charles, Antoine Cosson, Albane Garnier-Sauveplane, Lecat R\xe9my, Peresa Irena, Yuliya Vanzhulova","abstract":"This paper analyzes the impact on financial flows of institutional factors promoting financial integration such as European integration or trying to tame them such as capital control or macro-prudential policies.

To mitigate their price impact, buyers (sellers) of an asset postpone profitable trades, exposing themselves to upward (downward) future spot price movements: buyers (sellers) would like to buy (sell) futures.

Second, we characterize the extent and manner in which the wording of questions matters for the measurement of firms\u2019 inflation expectations. Third, we document whether and how the position of the respondent within the firm affects the provided responses. Fourth, because our survey measures firms\u2019 expectations about aggregate and firm-level wage growth along with their inflation expectations, we are able to show that expectations about wages are even more condensed than firms\u2019 inflation expectations and almost completely uncorrelated with them, indicating that firms perceive little link between price and wage inflation. Finally, an experimental treatment indicates that an exogenous change in firms\u2019 inflation expectations has no effect on their aggregate wage expectations.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/firms-inflation-expectations-new-evidence-france","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"21 October 2021"},{"id":678,"date":"10/20/2021","day":20,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Empirical Investigation of a Sufficient Statistic for Monetary Shocks","authors":"By Alvarez Fernando, Ferrara Andrea, Gautier Erwan, Le Bihan Herv\xe9, Lippi Francesco","abstract":"In a broad class of sticky price models the non-neutrality of nominal shocks is encoded by a simple sufficient statistic: the ratio of the kurtosis of the size-distribution of price changes over the frequency of price changes.

We use the micro data to measure the cross sectional moments, including kurtosis and frequency, for about 120 PPI industries and 220 CPI categories. We use a Factor Augmented VAR to measure the sectoral responses to a monetary shock, as summarized by the cumulative impulse response of sectoral prices (CIRP), under three alternative identification schemes. The estimated CIRP correlates with the kurtosis and the frequency consistently with the prediction of the theory - i.e. they enter the relationship as a ratio. The analysis also shows that other moments not suggested by the theory, such as the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the size-distribution of price changes, are not correlated with the CIRP.

We econometrically confirm this impact on self-employment in our set of 20 industries and we find that, at the end of the period, the reforms may have increased the share of self-employed workers in total employment by 5.5pp on average in the Netherlands, 2.5pp in the United Kingdom and 2pp in France. Then, we investigate the impact of reforms on total employment and value added using a difference-in-differences approach. In spite of a broad sensitivity analysis, we find no evidence that the reforms may have impacted either total employment or value-added. These results suggest that the reforms promoting self-employment may have raised the number of self-employed workers, but mostly through a substitution effect between the self-employed and employees, and not through a supply effect or a substitution effect with informal activities. This means that the reforms may have failed to achieve their main objectives.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/promoting-self-employment-does-it-create-more-employment-and-business-activity","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"19 October 2021"},{"id":681,"date":"18.10.2021","day":18,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Quantitative easing, safe asset scarcity and bank lending","authors":"Johannes Tischer","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/877524/0da10278c6e08183bb746035fc34174c/mL/2021-10-18-dkp-35-data.pdf","centralbank":"Bundesbank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"18 October 2021"},{"id":682,"date":"10/18/2021","day":18,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"The channels of banks\u2019 response to negative interest rates","authors":"By Boungou Whelsy, Hubert Paul","abstract":"Faced with a potential zero lower bound on deposit interest rates, how do banks pass on the fall in net interest income due to negative interest rates?

Survey respondents are requested to report their monthly wages, which we compare to their administrative, fiscal counterparts. We propose a well-defined index of worker-level uncertainty, which filters out their potential rounding behavior and reporting biases. We estimate it using unsupervised ML/EM techniques and find that workers tend to perceive their own wages with a degree of uncertainty of around 10%.\\nThrough the lens of a simple rational signal extraction model, this amounts to estimates of workers\' attention ranging from 30% to 84% depending on their wage, education, tenure and gender. Most importantly, we show that the attention of the lowest paid 30% of workers is cyclical and increases steadily by 17 percentage points in the ten days preceding payday, before immediately dropping on that day, which, through the lens of a simple model, is indicative of end-of-month financing liquidity constraints. Furthermore, this pattern reveals that the cognitive cost induced by these financing constraints arises from the not too concave (or convex) costs of achieving high levels of attention, and the convex costs of maintaining it over time","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/cognitive-load-financing-constraints-evidence-large-scale-wage-surveys","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"15 October 2021"},{"id":684,"date":"10/07/2021","day":7,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"Productivity Slowdown, Tax Havens and MNEs\u2019 Intangibles: where is Measured Value Creation?","authors":"By Bricongne Jean-Charles, Delpeuch Samuel, Lopez Forero Margarita","abstract":"Based on French firm-level data over around 15 years we evaluate the contribution of the micro-level profit shifting \u2013through tax haven foreign direct investments to the aggregate productivity slowdown measured in France. We show that firm measured productivity in France declines over the immediate years following the establishment in a tax haven, with an average estimated drop by 3.5% in labor apparent productivity. We argue that this productivity decline, following a presence in a tax haven, is most likely explained by multinationals\u2019 tax optimization, where domestic productivity is underestimated as profits are not recorded anymore in the home country. The fall in productivity is especially strong for firms that are intensive in intangible capital and is equivalent to 4.1% (versus 2.7% for low intangible intensive firms), reflecting the fact that these types of assets are more easily shifted across countries and facilitate tax planning. Our results additionally suggest that the mismeasurement has strong dynamic effects, as the decline becomes more important the longer the firm remains in a tax haven. Finally, given these firms\u2019 weight in the economy, our results imply an 8% loss at the aggregate in terms of the level of the labor productivity throughout the whole sample period, which is equivalent to an annual loss of 9.7% in terms of the aggregate annual labor productivity growth.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/productivity-slowdown-tax-havens-and-mnes-intangibles-where-measured-value-creation","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"7 October 2021"},{"id":685,"date":"10/05/2021","day":5,"month":10,"year":2021,"title":"How Powerful is Unannounced, Sterilized Foreign Exchange Intervention?","authors":"By Naef Alain, Weber Jacob P","abstract":"Though most central banks actively intervene on the foreign exchange market, the literature offers mixed evidence on their effectiveness: particularly for unannounced interventions.

Secondly, we estimate this shock at the firm level, enabling a thorough analysis of activity loss heterogeneity throughout the crisis. In particular, we shade light on the dispersion of the shock both within and between industries. We show that the industry the firm operates in explains up to 48% of the monthly activity shocks\u2019 variance weighted by employment, a much larger share than in a normal year. Finally, we leverage our monthly firm-level data on sales to show how corporate activity has evolved along four distinct trajectories throughout 2020.

Conditional on industry, the activity trajectory is also correlated with the ability to adapt some firms have demonstrated during the crisis in terms of organization and production.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/corporate-activity-france-amid-covid-19-crisis-granular-data-analysis","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 July 2021"},{"id":710,"date":"19.07.2021","day":19,"month":7,"year":2021,"title":"Lighting up the dark: Liquidity in the German corporate bond market","authors":"Yalin G\xfcnd\xfcz, Loriana Pelizzon, Michael Schneider, Marti G.

We show that a tolerance band should not be a zone of inaction: the lack of reaction within the band endangers macroeconomic stability and leads to the possibility of multiple equilibria; the trade-off between the reaction needed outside the range versus inside seems unfavorable: a very strong reaction, when inflation is far from the target, is required to compensate a moderately lower reaction within tolerance band; these results, obtained within the framework of a stylized model, are robust to many alterations, in particular allowing for the zero lower bound.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/inflation-tolerance-ranges-new-keynesian-model","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 June 2021"},{"id":716,"date":"06/17/2021","day":17,"month":6,"year":2021,"title":"Job Polarization and the Flattening of the Price Phillips Curve ","authors":"By Siena Daniele, Zago Riccardo","abstract":"This paper shows that the change in the occupational composition of the labor market in favour of non-routine jobs -i.e. job polarization- flattens the price Phillips Curve (PC).

Introducing NBFIs raises the importance of credit stabilization relative to other policy objectives in the welfare-based loss function of the regulator. The resulting optimal policy rule indicates that regulators adjust dynamic capital requirements more strongly in response to macroeconomic shocks due to credit leakage. Furthermore, introducing non-bank finance not only alters the cyclicality of optimal regulation, but also has implications for the optimal steady-state level of capital requirements and loan-to-value ratios.

We test the implications of this model for French exporters using the 2011 free trade agreement between the European Union and South-Korea as a quasi-natural experiment. We measure a bank\'s specialization in Korea using granular information on bank-firm credit lines and firm-level exports in the years preceding the agreement. We assess how customers of different banks react to this trade liberalization episode using detailed information on the bilateral tariff cuts and disaggregated data on French export flows at the firm-product level.

This paper assesses the interest of a procedure distinct from that for insolvent firms. It is based on the French experience, where a preventive procedure has coexisted with the more common restructuring procedure since 2006. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the Commercial Courts\' decisions allows the identification of the causal impact of the conversion from the preventive procedure to the common one on the firm\'s survival chances. Using an (almost) exhaustive sample of preventive bankruptcy fillings over 2010-2016, we show that conversion reduces the probability of firm survival by 50 p.p., which corresponds to indirect bankruptcy costs of around 20% of the firm assets. Our interpretation is that the low restructuring rate under the common bankruptcy procedure may alarm some of the firm\'s stakeholders, especially its customers. This in turn aggravates the firm\'s difficulties and reduces its chances of restructuring under the common procedure. We provide some empirical evidence to support this interpretation. A distinct preventive procedure helps prevent this spiral.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/bankruptcy-costs-and-design-preventive-restructuring-procedures","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"20 April 2021"},{"id":737,"date":"19.04.2021","day":19,"month":4,"year":2021,"title":"What drives the German TARGET balances?

The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing : the  ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement.

Overindebtedness now concerns financially fragile populations with low levels of debt. The main goal of this paper is to set up an explanatory model of overindebtedness. A first model highlights the significant impact of the standard of living on being overindebted. However, disparities remain between family structures. The main limitation of this first model is the fact that it relies essentially on aggregated data. Therefore, a second model, which is focused on the population of overindebted households only and uses a rich database, allows accounting for different factors playing a role in the orientation towards personal recovery, which is the orientation that is offered to the most financially vulnerable overindebted households.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/statistical-modelization-overindebtedness","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"12 February 2021"},{"id":749,"date":"08.02.2021","day":8,"month":2,"year":2021,"title":"Re-allocating taxing rights and minimum tax rates in international profit taxation","authors":"Gerhard Kempkes, Nikolai St\xe4hler","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/822290/79f914a2016c9b7041654f0d47734f28/mL/2021-02-08-dkp-03-data.pdf","centralbank":"Bundesbank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"8 February 2021"},{"id":750,"date":"02/08/2021","day":8,"month":2,"year":2021,"title":"The Dynamic Effects of the ECB\u2019s Asset Purchases: a Survey-Based Identification","authors":"By Lhuissier St\xe9phane, Nguyen Beno\xeet","abstract":"This paper estimates the dynamic effects of the ECB\'s asset purchase programme (APP) using a proxy structural vector autoregression.

Unexpected changes are inferred from public expectations released in quantitative surveys just before monetary policy announcements.

Overall, APP shocks account for less than a fifth of the long-run macroeconomic variability.

We build a tractable and quantifiable endogenous growth model with size-contingent regulations. We apply this to population administrative firm panel data from France, where many labour regulations apply to firms with 50 or more employees. Nonparametrically, we find that there is a sharp fall in the fraction of innovating firms just to the left of the regulatory threshold. Further, a dynamic analysis shows a sharp reduction in the firm\'s innovation response to exogenous demand shocks for firms just below the regulatory threshold. We then quantitatively fit the parameters of the model to the data, finding that innovation at the macro level is about 5.4% lower due to the regulation, a 2.2% consumption equivalent welfare loss. Four-fifths of this loss is due to lower innovation intensity per firm rather than just a misallocation towards smaller firms and lower entry. We generalize the theory to allow for changes in the direction of R&D, and find that regulation\'s negative effects only matter for incremental innovation (as measured by citations and text-based measures of novelty). A more regulated economy may have less innovation, but when firms do innovate they tend to \u201cswing for the fence\u201d with more radical (and labour saving) breakthroughs.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/impact-regulation-innovation","centralbank":"Banque de France","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"29 January 2021"},{"id":755,"date":"26/01/2021","day":26,"month":1,"year":2021,"title":"Learning on the Job and the Cost of Business Cycles (Updated January 2021)","authors":"Authors not mentioned on website, can be found in pdf","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.riksbank.se/globalassets/media/rapporter/working-papers/2019/no.-353-learning-on-the-job-and-the-cost-of-business-cycles-updated-january-2021.pdf","centralbank":"Bank of Sweden","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"26 January 2021"},{"id":756,"date":"26.01.2021","day":26,"month":1,"year":2021,"title":"A structural investigation of quantitative easing","authors":"Gregor Boehl, Gavin Goy, Felix Strobel","abstract":"Abstract not easily available without dowloading the pdf","linkarticle":"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/856942/7e54d0e3e2ca63ee39674805c366f6fe/mL/2021-01-26-dkp-01-data.pdf","centralbank":"Bundesbank","front":"Hover","back":"Back","date_text":"26 January 2021"},{"id":757,"date":"01/26/2021","day":26,"month":1,"year":2021,"title":"Heterogeneous Policy Distortions and the Labor Share","authors":"By Smagghue Gabriel","abstract":"I develop an extension of the neoclassical growth model in which firms are heterogeneous both in terms of labor share and productivity.

Our key finding is that the effectiveness of sales tax hikes differs notably across various model specifications, whereas the benefits of higher public infrastructure investment are more robust in alternative model environments.

This puzzle has triggered a debate on the global determinants of domestic prices. We contribute to this debate by investigating the impact of exchange rate shocks on consumer prices from 1995 to 2018. We focus on cost-push inflation through global value chains, using three sectoral world input-output datasets. Depending on countries, the absolute value of the elasticity of the household consumption expenditure (HCE hereafter) deflator to the exchange rate ranges from 0.05 to 0.35, confirming the importance of global value chains in channelling external shocks to domestic inflation. Using data from WIOD on a sample of 43 countries, we find that the mean output-weighted elasticity of the HCE deflator to the exchange rate increased in absolute value from 0.075 in 2000 to 0.094 in 2008. After peaking in 2008, it declined to 0.088 in 2014. World Input-Output tables (WIOT hereafter) are released with a lag of several years and the latest WIOT dates back to 2015. To fill this gap, we approximate the impact of an exchange rate shock on the HCE deflator from 2016 onwards using up-to-date GDP and trade data. Our extrapolations suggest that the decline in the elasticity of the HCE deflator continued until 2016, before reversing in 2017 and 2018. Our findings are robust to using three different datasets.","linkarticle":"https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/global-value-chains-and-transmission-exchange-rate-shocks-consumer-prices","centralbank":"Banque de
