		title: "Optimal trend inflation, misallocation and the pass-through of labour costs to prices",
		date: "21 December 2022",
		authors: "Sergio Santoro and Eliana Viviano",
		abstract: "We show that a sticky price model featuring firms’ heterogeneity in terms of produc- tivity and strategic complementarities in price setting delivers a strictly positive optimal inflation in steady state, differently from standard New Keynesian models. Due to strategic complementarities, more productive firms have higher markups in steady state. This leads to a misallocation distortion, as more productive firms produce too little compared to the social optimum. An increase of steady state inflation curbs the markups, especially those of the more productive firms, hence attenuating the inefficient dispersion of markups. At low levels of inflation, the gains from the reduction in misallocation outweigh the cost of inflation. Heterogeneity in productivity and strategic complementarities in price setting, the key ingredients of our model, imply that also firms’ response to shocks is heterogenous: less productive firms transmit cost shocks to prices much more than more productive ones. To provide empirical support to our key mechanism we resort to a quasi-natural exper- iment occurred in Italy in late 2014, when a cut to social security contributions for all new open-ended contracts was announced. Consistently with our theory, we show that the pass-through of this shock to labour costs was much stronger for less productive firms.",

		title: "Monetary communication rules",
		date: "19 December 2022",
		authors: "Laura Gáti, Amy Handlan",
		abstract: "Is there a systematic mapping between the Federal Reserve’s expectations of macro variables and the words it uses to talk about the economy? We propose a simple frame- work that allows us to estimate communication rules in the United States based on text analysis with regularized regressions. We find strong evidence for systematic com- munication rules that vary over time, with changes in the rule often being associated with changes in the economic environment or with the introduction of a new Fed chair. In the case of the fed funds rate, we also estimate the market’s perception of the Fed’s communication rule and use it to investigate how much of the disagreement between the market and the Fed come from disagreement about the communication rule.",

		title: "Monetary policy and credit card spending",
		date: "	13 January 2023",
		authors: " Francesco Grigoli and Damiano Sandri",
		abstract: "We analyze the impact of monetary policy on consumer spending using confidential credit card data. Being available at daily frequency, these data improve the identification of the monetary transmission and allow for a more precise characterization of the transmission lags. We find that shocks to short-term interest rates affect spending much more rapidly than shocks to medium-term interest rates. We also document significant asymmetries in the effects of monetary policy. While interest rate hikes strongly curb spending-especially if coupled with reductions in stock prices reflecting pure monetary policy shocks-interest rate cuts appear unable to lift spending. Finally, we exploit the disaggregation of credit card data to examine the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy across spending categories and users' characteristics.",

		title: "Macroeconomic Forecasting Using Filtered Signals from a Stock Market Cross Section",
		date: "25 December 2022",
		authors: "Chatelais Nicolas, Chinn Menzie, Stalla-Bourdillon Arthur",
		abstract: "Stock prices declined abruptly in the wake of the Covid-19, reflecting both the deterioration of investors’ expectations of economic activity as well as the surge in risk aversion. In the following months, however, economic activity remained sluggish while equity markets bounced back. This disconnect between equity values and macro-variables can be partially explained by other factors, namely the decline in risk-free interest rates, and -for the US- the strong profitability of the IT sector. As a result, an econometrician forecasting economic activity with aggregate stock market variables during the Covid-crisis is likely to get poor results. Our main contribution is thus to rely on sectorally disaggregated equity variables within a factor model in order to predict US economic activity. We find, first, that the factor model better predicts future economic activity compared to aggregate equity variables, or to conventional benchmarks used in the literature, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Second, we show that the strong performance of the factor model comes from the fact that it filters out the “expected returns” component of the sectoral equity variables as well as the foreign component of aggregate future cash flows. The constructed factor overweights upstream and “value” sectors that are found to be closely linked to the future state of the business cycle.",

		title: "Physical and transition risk premiums in euro area corporate bond markets",
		date: "3 January 2023",
		authors: "Joost Bats, Giovanna Bua, Daniel Kapp",
		abstract: " We study climate risk premiums in euro area corporate bond markets. As gauges of climate risk, we distinguish between physical and transition risks using textual analysis. Our findings show that, since the Paris agreement, physical risk is significantly priced in corporate bonds with longer-term maturities. Physical risk is also priced in bonds with shorter-term maturities, but the premium is smaller and less significant. The estimated physical risk premium reflects investors demanding higher future returns on bonds that underperform during adverse physical risk shocks. Our findings also point to a sizable transition risk premium, although the transition risk estimates are insignificant. ",

		authors: "Luigi Zingales",
		abstract: 'Digital markets are global in nature and prone to "tipping". The combination of these two factors makes the distortions of the inevitable monopolies in these markets very large, but it also undermines any effort at dealing with these distortions at a national level. I argue that the problem can only be solved by structural interventions that restore conditions for competition. Yet, no national regulator will have the ability to do so. Regulation can only arise in an international context. Paradoxically, the increasing international tension can create political opportunities for such international regulation.',

		title: "Real interest rates, bank borrowing, and fragility",
		date: "7 December 2022",
		authors: "Toni Ahnert, Kartik Anand, Philipp Johann König",
		abstract: "How do real interest rates affect financial fragility? We study this issue in a model in which bank borrowing is subject to rollover risk. A bank’s optimal borrowing trades off the benefit from investing additional funds into profitable assets with the cost of greater risk of a run by bank creditors. Changes in the interest rate affect the price and amount of borrowing, both of which influence bank fragility in opposite directions. Thus, the marginal impact of changes to the interest rate on bank fragility depends on the level of the interest rate. Finally, we derive testable implications that may guide future empirical work.",

		title: "Paying in a blink of an eye: it hurts less, but you spend more",
		date: "28 December 2022",
		authors: "Marie-Claire Broekhoff, Carin van der Cruijsen",
		abstract: "Consumers have been switching from cash to electronic means of paying and have become increasingly fond of online shopping. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these trends. What these trends imply for the pain of paying that consumers experience has barely been studied. As pain of paying can help prevent overspending, it is important to research this topic. We designed a detailed consumer survey to do so. Using this rich data on the Netherlands, we find that electronic payments – both online and offline – hurt less than cash payments. This holds especially for contactless payments and iDEAL payments, a frequently used online payment method in the Netherlands. Interestingly, we find this for older people in particular but not for teenagers. Furthermore, the pain of paying is positively related to the price of the product or service and slightly lower for a fun trip compared to grocery shopping. The pain of paying is relatively high for women, highly educated people, people without a partner, people who find it hard to make ends meet with their income, tightwads (i.e. frugal people), people who frequently check their payments account and people with a low level of financial literacy. On average, cash is perceived to be most helpful in preventing overspending, whereas contactless payments are the least helpful. ",

		title: "Sovereign Debt and International Trade",
		date: "26 December 2022",
		authors: "Charles Serfaty",
		abstract: "Evidence suggests that sovereign defaults disrupt international trade. As a consequence, countries that are more open have more to lose from a sovereign default and are less inclined to renege on their debt. In turn, lenders should trust more open countries and charge them with lower interest rate. In most cases, the country should also borrow more debt as it gets more open. This paper formalizes this idea in a sovereign debt model à la Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), proves these theoretical relations, and quantifies them in a calibrating model. We also provide evidence suggesting a causal relationship between trade and debt or CDS spreads, using gravitational instrumental variables from Frankel and Romer (1999) and Feyrer (2019) as a source for exogenous variation in trade openness.",
